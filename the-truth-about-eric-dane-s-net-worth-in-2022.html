Many also consider it as Dane’s breakout role, despite him working in Hollywood since the early '90s.As longtime viewers of the series may recall, Dane’s character was killed off shortly after the exit of his onscreen love interest, Lexie (Chyler Leigh). And while the actor briefly returned to reprise his role in the medical drama, it’s also safe to say that Dane has since moved on from playing McSteamy.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Grey's Anatomy' Star Eric Dane Once Appeared In This Marvel Movie</a></span>In fact, the veteran actor has been plenty busy since exiting the series. It is also worth noting that Dane also booked several major film roles while also working on the medical drama.These included projects across various genre, including sci-fi, adventure, drama, and romantic comedy.It is indeed a testament to Dane’s versatility as an actor. More importantly, this may also partly explain how he managed to amass his impressive net worth over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-may-best-be-known-for-his-tv-work-but-eric-dane-is-no-stranger-to-films>He May Best Be Known For His TV Work, But Eric Dane Is No Stranger To Films</h2><p>It may have been purely coincidental, but Dane ended up landing the part of Multiple Man in X-Men: The Last Stand around the same time that he got cast as Mark Sloan. Soon after, the actor also starred in the adventure drama Open Water 2: Adrift, which is based on true events.</p><p>Shortly after, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dane also joined the cast of the comedy-drama Marley & Me</a>, which was headlined by Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson. In the film, the actor played Wilson’s single friend Sebastian.</p><p>“Sebastian leads what seems to be an ideal single man’s lifestyle,” the actor explained during an interview with Emanuel Levy. “Sebastian is always happy to listen to John and give him advice – as long as a beautiful woman and potential conquest doesn’t walk by to distract them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eric Dane Gets Candid About Returning To 'Grey's Anatomy,' Says It's Like He 'Never Left'</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Dane also starred in the ensemble rom-com Valentine’s Day where he played an NFL player who is in a relationship with Bradley Cooper. The two actors even shared a kissing scene, which made their co-star, Jessica Alba, a tad “jealous.”</p><p>“In Valentine's Day when Bradley Cooper had his kissing scene with another actor... I was a bit like, 'Man! I could have been on that!’” the actress confessed while on The Kyle and Jackie O show for Australian radio channel 2DayFm.</p><h2 id=eric-dane-also-landed-some-major-series-roles-after-lsquo-grey-rsquo-s-anatomy-rsquo>Eric Dane Also Landed Some Major Series Roles After ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</h2><p>After working on a medical drama for years, Dane traded the OR for a battleship in the TNT drama The Last Ship. As it turns out, the project came at just the right time for the actor.</p><p>“It was three weeks after I’d wrapped Grey’s when this all happened, and it just was something I couldn’t pass up,” Dane told Showbiz Junkies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It just kind of unfolded perfectly and was just kind of the perfect storm of circumstances that led me here.”</p><p>The Last Ship was also produced by Michael Bay and for Dane, that was one of the show’s main selling points.</p><p>“Well, first of all, it was a Michael Bay show, and the action genre has always been intriguing to me,” the actor explained.</p><p>“I read the script and aside from it being whatever it is, virus, action, drama, no drama, it’s some of the best writing I’ve ever read.”</p><p>At the same time, showrunner Hank Steinberg also told The Hollywood Reporter that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bay was responsible for “getting Eric Dane to agree to do the pilot.”</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Of course, it doesn’t hurt to have Eric Dane if you’re looking for female viewership,” he later added. “That takes care of a lot of it off the bat.” The Last Ship went on for five seasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 'Grey's Anatomy' Star Eric Dane Trends For Very NSFW Reason</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>more recently, Dane joined the cast of the HBO hit drama Euphoria</a> as Nate’s (Jacob Elordi) father, Cal Jacobs. Early on, the actor made it clear that he was fully committed to portraying a married man harboring an explosive secret, even when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that involved a degree of nudity</a>.</p><p>“I’m willing to do anything that’s critical to the story and crucial to creating a very real and truthful feel to how the story is gonna go down,” Dane told Entertainment Weekly.</p><p>At one point, the actor even filmed a scene with frontal nudity as it was revealed that his character assaulted a 17-year-old trans girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I just don’t see how you shoot a scene like that without showing nudity,” the actor explained. “And, you know, it kind of matches the stakes. The stakes are so high, you can’t hold anything back, really.”</p><h2 id=this-is-eric-dane-rsquo-s-net-worth-today>This Is Eric Dane’s Net Worth Today</h2><p>According to estimates, Dane is currently worth anywhere between $7 and $8 million. At the moment, it is unclear how much the actor is getting paid for his role in Euphoria, especially since <a href=#>he's nearly unrecognizable to original Grey's fans</a>. That said, it is safe to say that his salary would be at par with his equally talented co-stars.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s also likely that Dane managed to negotiate a good fee for himself for his brief return on Grey’s Anatomy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, aside from Euphoria, Dane is also set to star in the upcoming crime drama Little Dixie.
