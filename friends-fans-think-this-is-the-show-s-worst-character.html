Of course, when a show goes on to achieve incredible success like that, there tends to be a lot of factors that play an important role in the series being so fully embraced. For example, the fact that Friends featured so many wonderful characters played an important role in its popularity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of the fact that Friends fans typically adore the series’ core six, the show featured supporting characters that were great as well. For that reason, Friends was the kind of show that <a href=#>a comedy legend tried so hard to be a part of that he was rejected twice</a>. Of course, no matter how great a show is, no series is going to be perfect. For example, Friends featured some characters that continue to be unpopular with the series’ fans. In fact, when it comes to Friends fans, there seems to be a consensus that one character is the series’ worst.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Times Gunther Was The Best Character On 'Friends'</a></span></p><h2 id=other-options>Other Options</h2><p>During the mid-2010s, it had already been several years since Friends finale aired the first time. As a result, it seemed like the perfect time for fans of the series to come together and discuss the series’ many highlights and its few lowlights. With that in mind, in 2014, a Friends fan went on the subreddit r/howyoudoin to ask a simple question, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which character on Friends was your least favorite?</a>”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the reply section of the aforementioned Reddit thread, the top-ranked response had a sizable lead over the other options. As a result, it is quite clear that Friends fans tend to agree that one specific character was the series’ worst. That said, several other replies were in the running for the top slot as well which means the characters that were mentioned in them are very unpopular as well.</p><p>According to the aforementioned Reddit thread, the second least popular Friends character is Mona, the woman Ross dated during the eighth season. That said, it is surprising that Mona ranked so high since the actor who brought her to life, Bonnie Sommerville, typically is delightful and several users came to the character’s defense in the Reddit thread.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The third most disliked Friends character seems to be Danny, the guy Rachel dated during the fifth season. Unlike Mona, nobody in the Reddit thread seems to enjoy Danny. After all, according to the comments, Friends fans really didn’t like the way that Rachel acted during her relationship with Danny, and the strange relationship he had with his sister was offputting.</p><p>In a surprising pick, Friends fans in the aforementioned Reddit thread next called out Marcel the white-headed capuchin monkey as particularly easy to dislike. Some of the other characters that were brought up in the conversation include Russ, Paolo, Emily, Tag, Bonnie, Julie, Gary, and Rachel’s sisters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Friends: 15 Controversies Fans Might Not Know</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-worst-character>Friends Worst Character</h2><p>In the aforementioned Reddit thread about Friends’ worst character, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a reply that mentioned the user’s distaste for Janine got the most upvotes</a>. As the Reddit user who nominated Janine explains, they “hated that (they) had to endure Janine to watch the episode where Monica and Ross do the routine for New Years”. Considering that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed included the routine in their list of the “cringey ‘Friends’ moments that almost ruined the show entirely”</a>, it says a lot that the user liked the dance much more than Janine. For anyone who doesn’t recall her character, Janine was brought to life by the supermodel Elle Macpherson during the show’s sixth season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ranking The 20 Best (And Worst) Celebrity Cameos From Friends</a></span></p><p>When Janine first shows up in Friends, her character becomes Joey’s roommate. Unfortunately, from the moment that Janine debuted, it was clear that the character was pretty one-dimensional. However, at first, Janine was inoffensive and the crush that Joey had on her was played for some pretty good laughs during her first episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, it didn’t take too long for Joey and Janine to become a couple and at that point, the reason why Friends fans dislike her character so much quickly becomes clear. After all, shortly after Janine starts dating Joey, she begins to talk about disliking Chandler and Monica. Since most Friends fans love Monica and Chandler it seemed outrageous that Janine didn’t. Of course, sometimes perfectly nice people don’t mix well so that fans might have been about to let that go. However, as it quickly became clear, Janine isn’t a nice character. After all, Janine went on to insult Monica to her face which results in the two women fighting and Joey thankfully sees the light and ends the relationship. At that point, Janine is never seen again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Some 'Friends' Fans Think This Was One Of The Worst Episodes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaSVYrqir8%2BhnKurn6N6q63NoqWeZZantqa6w6xksKeiqMFur8eaqZqbpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./another-old-school-name-set-chyna-films-an-adult-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Another Old School Name Set, Chyna Films an Adult Movie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wingsofredemption-biography-wife-age-weight-real-name-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wingsofredemption Biography, Wife, Age, Weight, Real Name, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
