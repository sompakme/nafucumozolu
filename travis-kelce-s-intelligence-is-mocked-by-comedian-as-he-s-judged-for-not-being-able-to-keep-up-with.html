She referred to their coupling as "unlikely" but also revealed that it's for this reason that so many people have shown their support for the couple. "It just makes sense. We're obsessed," she added. <a href=#>Kelce has also made self-deprecating jokes</a> about himself before.</p><p><strong>Swift's relationship history is well-known; in the past, she has appeared to fall hard for her partners (and her relationships have inspired her songwriting). Oshry also commented on this, saying how this new coupling with Kelce provides a "lightness" compared to Swift's past</strong>.

What is serious, though, is their relationship</strong>. There have been many reports about how they are <a href=#>already thinking about having babies</a> and have shown their support for each other. This includes <a href=#>Kelce's plans to travel to Europe to support Swift's Eras tour</a>.

Another also weighed in on the comparisons between Travis and Swift. "Man, I get tired of people thinking he's famous because of his girlfriend. Sheesh.
