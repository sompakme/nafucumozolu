Before social media, skills and looks were the most-reliable route there. Now that digital platforms can show a granola bowl, a Gucci shopping trip, and a grueling workout in the click of a button, living the famous life has taken on a whole new meaning. Kim Kardashian can take as many closet selfies as she chooses – her entire family is making millions from doing just that. Jay Z and Beyonce might be spending a lot of time on private jets at the moment, but their On The Run tour is making them more famous than ever. Whether it's Justin Bieber buying his new fiancée a Canadian mansion or Ariana Grande stepping out in another over-the-knee boot look, some celebs just soak up the limelight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not all famous faces enjoy the spotlight, though. For every paparazzi-loving star, there's a hideaway face ducking behind cars. Fame is something this lot are actively trying to avoid. Fans are always surprised to learn that Lady Gaga or Chris Evans are actually shy. Some celebs, like Jennifer Lawrence, have even publicly said that famous people should have "time off." There's a problem, though. Fame doesn't come with a vacation (even when it's vacation time). We'll be looking at the celebs who adore the fame, and those who don't care for&nbsp;it. Here are 13 of each, plus great examples showing which side they're on.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-can-t-get-enough-of-it><strong>KYLIE JENNER CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT</strong></h2><p>If anyone was born to roll in fame, it's Kylie Jenner. Nobody predicted that the youngest Kardashian-Jenner would rise above her sisters, but that $900 million net worth has landed this 21 year-old a Forbes magazine cover. "I don't think about it if I didn't have to be famous," Kylie told The Evening Standard. Just as well. Who has the time to think about fame when there are $1.4 million Ferraris to be bought (and Louis Vuitton stores to be emptied)?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-watson-struggles-with-fame><strong>EMMA WATSON STRUGGLES WITH FAME</strong></h2><p>Some might say that you can't have your cake and eat it. Emma Watson has netted $60 million from the Harry Potter franchise, according to Hollywood Reporter. That's without her other screen work and high-profile Chanel and Burberry contracts. Alongside saying in 2013 that she would "never date someone famous," Emma has revealed to Cosmopolitan that fame is something that she finds very difficult. "I never realized I was famous until I went to America," Emma said in 2013.&nbsp;"I deal with fame horribly," Emma Watson once said.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-handles-fame-just-fine><strong>ARIANA GRANDE HANDLES FAME JUST FINE</strong></h2><p>You need a strong head on your shoulders to handle international fame in 2018. Ariana Grande is managing it just fine. Given Ariana's willingness to spend 2018 sharing her engagement news and promoting her Sweetener album, you could say that Ariana has taken a liking to the limelight. "I think people see me as a cutesy thing," Ariana told Billboard in 2014. Still channeling the bubblegum image, but doing a way more polished job than she did in former years, Ariana is 100% loving being Little Miss Headline Maker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-evans-doesn-t-like-being-the-hero><strong>CHRIS EVANS DOESN'T LIKE "BEING THE HERO"</strong></h2><p>Even Captain America himself doesn't like being the hero, it would seem. Chris Evans has shot to fame as the all-American poster boy in the Avengers franchise, but this is one actor who prefers to hide behind the cape. Back in 2009, Chris was telling The Boston Globe how "avoiding becoming Brad Pitt" was on his agenda. Now that Chris is arguably more famous than Brad, he is stepping back. Captain America "took too much out of him," so expect more of Chris taking up director jobs.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-has-fame-on-a-roll><strong>NICKI MINAJ HAS FAME ON A ROLL</strong></h2><p>Bold and brazen, the rapper with "Barbie" as her alter ego isn't one to shy away from the cameras. Nicki Minaj is now the most powerful and highest-paid woman in hip-hop. With her Ariana Grande collaboration, 2018 Queen album, and newly signed Mercedes-Benz deal, this artist knows exactly what she is doing. In a 2018 interview with Apple Music, Nicki said that fans often treat her as an inanimate object – "as if [I'm] a Barbie doll." Well, Nicki, you chose the name, not us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-feels-she-deserves-time-off><strong>JENNIFER LAWRENCE FEELS SHE DESERVES "TIME OFF"</strong></h2><p>For every grateful celebrity, there's a celebrity complainer. Despite being one of the highest-paid actresses in the world, Jennifer Lawrence feels that "time off" should be part of the fame deal. Speaking to Glamour, J-Law said: "I would love to be able to control being photographed." Three months is what Jen feels that she should get as "time off." Jen doesn't want to be judged for "wearing the same jeans three days in a row."</p><p><strong>"Oh, it's my three months off. You can't photograph me."</strong></p><h2 id=kim-k-eats-fame-for-breakfast><strong>KIM K EATS FAME FOR BREAKFAST</strong></h2><p>If anyone is loving fame in Hollywood right now, it's Kim Kardashian. The "famous for being famous" star has monetized on every single second of her life, and the $350 million net worth is living proof. You're looking at a celebrity who has released an entire book of selfies titled Selfish. In 2018, Radar reported that Kim's ex-assistant, Stephanie Shepherd had called Kim "vain." "Kim "took 6,000 selfies on a 4-day Mexico vacation." So, apparently, a celeb who loves her job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp-is-very-shy><strong>JOHNNY DEPP IS&nbsp;VERY SHY</strong></h2><p>From the man who brought us Captain Jack Sparrow, you might expect Johnny Depp to have confidence as his middle name. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor may be rich beyond belief, but he is also incredibly shy. In a 2014 Today interview, Johnny compared dodging the paparazzi to living "the life of a fugitive." This is a guy who&nbsp;dislikes living in the public eye, to where getting "into the hotel, out of the hotel" or "some restaurant" is very intimidating.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid-is-enjoying-the-rise-in-fame><strong>GIGI HADID IS ENJOYING THE&nbsp;RISE IN FAME</strong></h2><p>There's stiff competition in the modeling world. If any industry comes with a short shelf life, it's a career in modeling. Gigi Hadid is the "it" girl that everybody wants in their squad (and every designer wants on their billboard). With over 42 million Instagram followers and a One Direction ex-boyfriend, this girl is well-connected – but she's also well-heeled. Gigi's father has a net worth of $400 million, according to Forbes.&nbsp;With her confidence, Victoria's Secret, and Fendi contracts, Gigi may out-earn her dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendall-jenner-is-anxious-about-fame><strong>KENDALL JENNER&nbsp;IS ANXIOUS ABOUT FAME</strong></h2><p>There are two sides to Kendall Jenner. One side is super-confident, super-outgoing, and perfectly happy wearing very little clothing. The other side is the real Kendall. In a 2018 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Kendall opened up about the anxiety issues that being famous has left her with. With four famous sisters and her face all over the media, Kendall actually wishes that her life was more low-key.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-channels-fame-into-good-deeds><strong>DWAYNE JOHNSON CHANNELS FAME INTO GOOD DEEDS</strong></h2><p>For all the self-obsessed faces filling Hollywood, you can always fall back on Dwayne Johnson for a bit of kindness. Dwayne is a literal rock – from his 260 lbs of muscle, to the way he chooses to handle his wealth. In 2018, The Observer reported that Dwayne had earned $124 million in 2017. That cash doesn't exclusively go towards fast cars and flashy suits. In fact, Dwayne randomly surprised his housekeeper with a brand new truck. Dwayne supports endless charities, plus he actually visits the hospitals in person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-johansson-stays-out-of-the-spotlight><strong>SCARLETT JOHANSSON STAYS OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT</strong></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson is a force of nature. The Avengers star has already signed a $25 million deal for her own Black Widow movie, but you won't see Scarlett emptying Versace. In fact, it's pretty hard to find a street photo of Scarlett that doesn't have her looking remarkably ordinary. You'll see plenty of on-screen confidence with Scarlett, but the real-life story is more about dodging cameras than ushering in the attention. The twice-divorced mom is also fiercely private about her personal life.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-loves-the-limelight><strong>ROBERT DOWNEY JR. LOVES THE LIMELIGHT</strong></h2><p>From one Avenger to another– but these two actors couldn't be more different. Robert Downey Jr. earned $48 million in 2017, according to Forbes. This guy is mega-rich, mega-charming, and totally owning his A-list status. With RDJ though, the confidence can't help but be endearing. Also, this guy deserves it. Robert spent most of the 90s having every Hollywood door slammed in his face. "From lost cause to highest-paid Hollywood actor" was The Guardian's headline in 2017. If anyone pulls off fame, it's Robert Downey Jr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-stewart-wishes-she-weren-t-famous><strong>KRISTEN STEWART WISHES SHE WEREN'T FAMOUS</strong></h2><p>It's no secret that Kristen Stewart has been trying to crawl her way out of Hollywood. The Twilight actress has had to face both regular fame and some personal&nbsp;struggles that haven't exactly played into her favor. In a 2015 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Kristen said that red carpet appearances and interviews mean too much "human energy thrust at you." Kristen ended the interview with some strong words. She said, "Fame is the worst thing in the world. Especially if it's pointless."</p><h2 id=beyonce-uses-fame-to-run-this-world><strong>BEYONCE USES FAME TO "RUN THIS WORLD"</strong></h2><p>Fame was something Beyonce was hell-bent on achieving from the moment she joined Destiny's Child in the 90s. To be fair, you're also looking at someone who ditched the group act to go solo, so you could say that Beyonce had fame as her personal destiny. Now that Bey is married to Jay Z, this power couple has a net worth of $1.16 billion. Beyonce is the kinds of famous that don't need a last name. Full-on swag and full-on vocals... Beyonce and fame are like two peas in a pod.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lady-gaga-is-a-shy-introvert><strong>LADY GAGA IS A SHY INTROVERT</strong></h2><p>With those statement costumes and iconic stage performances, you could be forgiven for thinking that Lady Gaga is an outgoing extrovert – in fact, she is the exact opposite. Speaking to Hollywood Scoop about her shyness, the Joanne singer said: "I always feel shy in the Hollywood scene." Gaga added that she finds the celebrity scene "a bit like high school," where she recalls not fitting in. Then again, this star is loved for being "Born This Way." Gaga is shy underneath the loud flourishes, though.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-is-all-about-fame><strong>BLAC CHYNA&nbsp;IS ALL ABOUT FAME</strong></h2><p>With an Instagram account that is mostly pictures of herself in&nbsp;eye-popping outfits, Blac Chyna isn't one to hide from the cameras. The reality star and baby mama to Rob Kardashian is so&nbsp;into&nbsp;fame, she actually appears displeased when others out-do her. When E!News reported that Chyna is "suing the Kardashians" over her Rob & Chyna show being canceled, nobody was surprised. People still wonder what Blac Chyna is famous for, but if you're Googling her, it's a sign that she has reached her goal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-alba-likes-to-keep-a-low-profile><strong>JESSICA ALBA LIKES TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE</strong></h2><p>Some celebs love stepping out of their homes to a swarm of flashing paparazzi. Others&nbsp;don't like it. Jessica Alba may have featured in Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood" video, but hanging with famous squads is not how this mom likes to roll. "I don't like being the center of attention," Jessica told Elle. Yes, she is an internationally recognized actress. Yes, she has a skincare line. 13.6 million people subscribe to Jess' Instagram account, but the actress herself prefers to keep things simple and low-key.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-demands-money-from-fame><strong>JENNIFER LOPEZ DEMANDS MONEY FROM FAME</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez has never forgotten her humble Bronx beginnings. "We shared a mattress," Jen told The Guardian. Jenny From The Block she may be, but&nbsp;she moves in different circles now. The singer is reported to have demanded up to $20 million per American Idol cycle, according to The Daily Mail. With a reputation as a bit of a diva, J-Lo&nbsp;is a lady who likes fine surroundings, lots of cameras, and a sell-out Las Vegas residency. But hey! She can entertain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cardi-b-was-happier-before-she-was-famous><strong>CARDI B WAS HAPPIER BEFORE SHE WAS FAMOUS</strong></h2><p>On first impressions, Cardi B is a fame-loving machine with a mouth that says it how it is. The rapper has shot to A-lister in relatively little time, but that's what being unique will get you. In 2018, Cardi spoke to Refinery 29, saying that "the dark and unexpected" side of fame gave this industry a negative side.&nbsp;Despite a love of designer clothes and diamond-encrusted watches in her lyrics, Cardi's true feelings tell a different story.</p><p><strong>"I feel like I was a little bit happier two or three years ago when I had less money," Cardi B said.</strong></p><h2 id=kris-jenner-sees-fame-as-a-business-opportunity><strong>KRIS JENNER SEES FAME AS A&nbsp;BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY</strong></h2><p>With her five kids taking over the world, it's easy to forget the rock of a "momager" managing them all. Kris Jenner is the shrewd businesswoman who has a say in all of her kids' business deals – from sealing the $150 million deal to extend KUWTK, to negotiating Kylie Jenner's photo shoot rates. Kris adores fame. Her social media shows her promoting Kim or Kylie's products, plus she hangs out on yachts with Tommy Hilfiger. Whether she's going to dinner or attending fashion week, Kris makes sure she is #FrontPage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zayn-malik-didn-t-take-well-to-fame><strong>ZAYN MALIK DIDN'T TAKE WELL TO FAME</strong></h2><p>There's a risk when you audition with Simon Cowell. Most people welcome it – the chance to become part of the biggest pop group on the planet. Zayn Malik joined One Direction as a teenager, and it wasn't long before his face was everywhere. In 2015, Zayn left 1D with the following statement: "I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight." Zayn is one of Hollywood's biggest introverts.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-adores-her-fame-and-her-fans><strong>TAYLOR SWIFT ADORES&nbsp;HER FAME AND HER FANS</strong></h2><p>Pulling off confidence with a humble edge is a valuable skill. No one does it better than Taylor Swift. The butter-wouldn't-melt woolies and Instagram cat pics give this multi-millionaire a relatable edge, but don't be fooled. Taylor Swift is in it for the worldwide attention from her fans, and she loves being center-stage. Dramatically deleting your entire social media just for an album buildup? This girl knows how to create hype. 2018 marks Taylor's tour. In 2016, her then-boyfriend, Tom Hiddleston wore an "I Love T.S." t-shirt. She clearly enjoys the perks of fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-craig-is-trying-to-get-out-of-fame><strong>DANIEL CRAIG IS TRYING TO "GET OUT OF FAME"</strong></h2><p>Most people would jump at the chance to become 007 James Bond. With his steel-blue eyes, blonde features, and chiseled physique, Daniel Craig was a no-brainer for the spy movie franchise. Casino Royale in 2006 marked Daniel's first 007 appearance, but this actor hasn't found fame easy. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Daniel said: "I've been trying to get out of this from the very moment I got into it. But they won't let me go." He concluded that "business is business."</p><h2 id=ariel-winter-doesn-t-mind-attention-from-paparazzi><strong>ARIEL WINTER DOESN'T MIND ATTENTION FROM PAPARAZZI&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Enjoying fame isn't a bad thing. There's a fine line between pulling off fame and&nbsp;searching for it. With a social media feed that looks increasingly like Kylie Jenner's, Ariel Winter is showing us one thing: she is willing to do what it takes to get people talking. The Modern Family actress is already in one of the most popular TV shows around. Her mother spoke to The Daily Mail, though, regarding her daughter's mannerisms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-is-happier-when-he-is-left-alone><strong>EMINEM IS HAPPIER WHEN HE IS LEFT ALONE</strong></h2><p>When you're the best selling artist of the 2000s, fame will follow you wherever you go. Eminem is arguably the world's most-skilled rapper, but you only have to listen to his lyrics to hear his thoughts on fame. In the MMLP2 album, Em raps about not being able to use a restroom without being bothered by fans. The biggest sign that Em doesn't want the Hollywood lifestyle? Owning a home in Detroit and insisting on living there. Em wanted one thing from his success – to give his daughter, Hailey, the "life he never had."
