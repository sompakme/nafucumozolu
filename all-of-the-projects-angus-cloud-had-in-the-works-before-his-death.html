As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways,” the star’s family said in a statement at the time.</p><p>Cloud’s family went on to state that they hope his passing will serve “as a reminder” to those struggling with mental health problems “that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence.”</p><p>Scroll below to learn more about Cloud’s upcoming projects.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with their mental health, contact the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><h3>‘Your Lucky Day’</h3><p>Released in November 2023, Cloud stars as Sterling, a man who takes a convenience store hostage in an attempt to steal a $156 million lottery ticket.

Co-directed by <a href=#>Captain Marvel</a>’s <strong>Anna Boden</strong> and <strong>Ryan Fleck</strong>, the movie will center around “four interconnected stories set in Oakland, California” and “will tell about the love of music, movies, people, places and memories beyond our knowable universe,” according to the film’s <a href=#>IMDb page</a>.</p><h3>‘Abigail’</h3><p>The horror comedy stars Cloud, <strong>Kathryn Newton</strong>, <strong>Dan Stevens</strong>, <strong>Melissa Barrera</strong>, <strong>Kevin Durand</strong>, <strong>William Catlett</strong> and <strong>Giancarlo Esposito</strong> as a group of criminals who kidnap a young girl named Abigail (<strong>Alisha Weir</strong>) in order to collect a $50 million ransom. Upon discovering Abigail is actually a vampire, the group must work together to survive the night. The film, which hit theaters in April 2024, is helmed by Scream VI codirectors <strong>Matt Bettinelli-Olpin</strong> and <strong>Tyler Gillett</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>‘Euphoria’</h3><p>Though Euphoria season 3 was <a href=#>delayed until 2025</a> due to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, Cloud was seemingly expected to return as Fezco for the series’ third installment. His character ended season 2 on a dire note, as Fezco’s adoptive younger brother, Ashtray (<strong>Javon Walton</strong>), was killed after he fought back against a SWAT team that infiltrated their house. Throughout the season, Fezco also developed a sweet romance with <a href=#><strong>Maude Apatow</strong></a>’s Lexi Howard, though his brother’s death caused him to miss the premiere of her school play.</p><p>No details about how the series will handle Cloud’s death or Fezco’s fate have been revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilpF2ks27Ax55kqaqfn7KkwNJmmKefpah6pLjOrptmoJGZeqq6jK2fnmWnpL%2Bsv4ybnJ%2Bnopp6qbXSZpuemaSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pokemon-go-blogs-top-pokemon-go-blogs-and-websites.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pokemon Go Blogs Top Pokemon Go Blogs and Websites</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adele-will-not-tolerate-candid-pictures-of-her-son-angelo-adkins.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adele Will Not Tolerate Candid Pictures Of Her Son Angelo Adkins</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
