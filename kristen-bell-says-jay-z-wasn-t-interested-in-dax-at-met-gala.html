Everything was on the table, jokes, sincerity, admiration, you name it, I gave him, like, 120 percent.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Met-Gala-Dax-Shepherd-and-Kristen-Bell-and-Jay-Z-and-Beyonce.jpg><p>Sadly, Shepard concurred that the “99 Problems” singer was immune to his charms. “I promise you if we had bumped into each other in the bathroom mid-meal, he’d have no idea I was sitting next to him. I’m convinced,” said the comedian.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jay-Z did seem to take note of Shepard’s wife, however: “I think all I was was like a roadblock to look at Kristen. That’s my hunch, yeah.”</p><p>The actor said he learned his lesson, telling Corden, 40, if he saw the Grammy winner again, “I’d flip it. I’d now treat him like the hottest girl in high school and ignore him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jJucpaRdqK66v4yjmLJlqmLEor%2FNrWSipqSav6a%2F056bZqGeYrGixIyaq2allal6qK3LmmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bizarre-rumor-that-india-arie-is-secretly-chris-tucker-s-girlfriend-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Bizarre Rumor That India Arie Is Secretly Chris Tucker's Girlfriend, Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
