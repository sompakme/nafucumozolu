I didn’t even know myself,” King told the<a href=#>&nbsp;New York Post’s Page Six</a> in July 2019 of her short-lived relationship with McDill, which ended in 2011. “I wanted to be like my parents’ perfect marriage. I just thought I was going to have the same love story, because why not? I’ve done everything else like my parents, so why wouldn’t it work out?”</p><p>The former reality star <a href=#>quickly found love again with Edmonds</a> in 2013, after meeting one year prior. The twosome had a public romance <a href=#>during their five-year marriage</a> and welcomed three children: daughter Aspen in 2016 and twin sons Hart and Hayes in 2018.</p><p>Their breakup was equally as newsworthy after <a href=#>King accused Edmonds of having an affair</a> before they separated, which the former center fielder denied. The messy divorce, however, didn’t keep the “Intimate Knowledge” podcast cohost from <a href=#>searching for Mr. Right</a>.</p><p>“I just want a partner, right? I just want somebody who’s supporting me and isn’t jealous or trying to suppress,” she said on her podcast in January 2020. “You know, somebody who grows with me — instead of, like, staying stagnant at a certain place. Like, to me that’s intimacy. I just need that partner next to me who’s gonna hold my hand.”</p><p>King exclusively told Us Weekly in January 2021 what it was like getting back into the dating game after a brief romance with <a href=#><strong>Christian Schauf</strong></a> in 2020.</p><p>“It’s a little bleaker,” <a href=#>she jokingly said of the men in St. Louis</a>, which is her hometown and current place of residence. “The men overall are not quite as interesting, in my opinion, but there’s definitely upsides. They are more, I would say, true to themselves, more family-oriented. There’s definitely pros and cons, which is all the reasons I love St. Louis and all the reasons I hate St. Louis, and vice-versa with L.A. I need to find that guy who’s the perfect mix of the St. Louis values with the L.A. attitude.”</p><p>Four months later, after finalizing her divorce from Edmonds, King told Us about <a href=#>her new outlook on finding a forever partner</a>.</p><p>“Let’s be honest, like, to be in a rush might not be the smartest decision. I definitely just enjoy my time and I don’t feel like I have to do anything quote unquote by the book anymore,” she said in May 2021. “So, I feel really comfortable with who I am, where I stand and I don’t need, you know, paperwork to tell me who I love.”</p><p>Just five months later, it was announced that she was set to <a href=#>walk down the aisle and marry Owens</a>, who is the nephew of <a href=#><strong>President Joe Biden</strong></a> in a small ceremony at the groom’s parents’ house in Pennsylvania. King kept the relationship very quiet, never announcing the engagement. The surprise marriage news was confirmed by the President’s daily travel schedule. Two months after the October 2021 nuptials, <a href=#>the duo called it quits</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In July 2022, Us confirmed that the reality TV alum had moved on with CEO <a href=#><strong>Trevor Colhoun</strong></a>. “They’ve been <a href=#>going strong for three months</a>,” a source exclusively revealed at the time. “She’s been doing everything she can to keep the relationship private.” The insider added that the couple was dating long-distance, with Colhoun residing in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><p>Scroll down to see who King has dated over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqazx5qlZqOZo7S0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZaSdv7DBxqFkraCVYsamrdGsZKmgn6m8tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./renee-zellweger-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Renee Zellweger Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-kim-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Kims Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
