Because so many people do the same thing and hide it as well.”</p><p>Sheeran shared that he “found myself doing what<a href=#><strong> Elton [John]</strong></a> explains in his [2019 memoir, Me] – gorging, and then it would come up again.”</p><p>The Grammy winner also confessed to having problems with binge-eating, as well as an addictive personality. During the Hay House Chasing the Present Summit in July 2020, Sheeran revealed that touring took a large toll on his health. “For me, it was down to, like, bad diet, drinking, and then not seeing sunlight at all [while] I was touring,” he said at the time.</p><p>Two months before the “Thinking Out Loud” singer and wife, <a href=#><strong>Cherry Seaborn</strong></a>, welcomed their first child, Sheeran decided to heavily cut back on his alcohol consumption. “Cherry said, ‘If my waters break, do you really want someone else to drive me to the hospital?’ Because I was just drinking a lot. And that’s when it clicked,” he divulged to Rolling Stone in 2023. “I was like, ‘No, actually, I really don’t.’ And I don’t ever want to be pissed holding my kid.”</p><p>Now, the England native has focused his binge habits on more positive practices. “I’m now more of a binge exerciser, and a binge dad,” he concluded.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jordan Fisher</strong></a> has also opened up about his eating struggles. The actor and wife, <strong>Elli Woods</strong>, welcomed their first child in June 2022, and it was during her pregnancy that Fisher was “<a href=#>diagnosed with an eating disorder</a> that I did not know I had,” he disclosed on The Drew Barrymore Show in April 2023..</p><p>“My last couple months of [a work] contract were very, very difficult physical times for me,” the To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You actor revealed. “I lost 30 pounds [and] I actually never talked about this out loud on a platform like this at all, and man, I’m so glad I made it through that desert because here we are now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Sheeran, Fisher and more male celebs who have shared their struggles with eating disorders and body image issues.</p><p>If you or someone you know struggles with an eating disorder, visit the <a href=#>National Association of Anorexia Nervosa & Associated Disorders</a> (ANAD) website or call their hotline at (888)-375-7767 to get help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkuqK4xGaqrZmiqHq4tM5mn5qulWLBorjKnptmnZGptq%2BzjJ2grKeimbKzv4ybpp2xXZ66orPEZqCsq6WawHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nic-nemeth-set-to-compete-at-njpw-windy-city-riot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nic Nemeth Set To Compete At NJPW Windy City Riot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lupin-cast-net-worth-richest-cast-members-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lupin Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
