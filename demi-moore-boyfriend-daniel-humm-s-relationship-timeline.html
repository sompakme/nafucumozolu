He is best known as the chef/owner of <a href=#>Eleven Madison Park</a> in New York City, which is regarded as one of the best restaurants in the world. In June 2021, Humm made waves in the food world when he transitioned the acclaimed eatery’s <a href=#>menu to be entirely vegan</a>, making it the first restaurant with three Michelin stars to serve entirely plant-based food.</p><p>Like Moore, the NoMad Cookbook author is divorced and he shares three children with his first wife, <strong>Geneen Wright</strong>. The Ghost actress, for her part, was married to <strong>Freddy Moore</strong> from 1980 until 1985, before tying the knot with <a href=#><strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a> two years later. The pair welcomed three daughters: <a href=#><strong>Rumer</strong></a> in 1988, <a href=#><strong>Scout</strong></a> in 1991 and <a href=#><strong>Tallulah</strong></a> in 1994.</p><p><a href=#>Moore and Willis called it quits</a> in 2000 after 11 years of marriage. Despite their split, the Stakeout costars have <a href=#>maintained a close relationship</a> and often <a href=#>celebrate their blended family</a>. (Willis married <a href=#><strong>Emma Heming Willis</strong></a> in 2009 and they share two daughters, Mabel and Evelyn.)</p><p>“It’s a process of learning to love yourself,” Moore — who was also married to <a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a> from 2005 to 2013 — said during a July 2020 appearance on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Show about navigating <a href=#>the ups and downs of her love life</a>. “Accepting who you are just as you are. For me, I had changed myself so many times over and over to fit what I thought somebody else wanted.”</p><p>She continued: “It’s that idea that we’re kinda conditioned to work toward being desired, but we’re not supposed to have desires of our own. It really is commendable in our disposal times to go through the journey of really honoring the love that brought you together in the first place and to really give it everything you’ve got. But you can’t do that without that love and acceptance of yourself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After less than one year of dating, <a href=#>Us broke the news</a> in November 2022 that the duo called it quits.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the complete timeline of Moore and Humm’s whirlwind romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksaa5yGakqKeimnqju9ifqaKdnpl6pa3NopylZZiquq6%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jillian-grace-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jillian Grace Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./britney-spears-defends-her-controversial-memoir-as-it-ruins-multiple-marriages.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Britney Spears Defends Her Controversial Memoir As It Ruins Multiple Marriages</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
