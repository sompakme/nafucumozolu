However, his lack of punctuation caused fans to misunderstand his message.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“Hate that man … Praying for the best,” Mahomes <a href=#>wrote via X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), to which confused comments began pouring in. Realizing his grammatical flub, the athlete quickly edited the post to read, “Hate that, man … Praying for the best.” He <a href=#>added in a follow-up tweet</a>: “Knew I was going to need that edit button on here one of these days,” with a crying laughing emoji.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Fans quickly took to the comments section to jokingly roast Mahomes for his error. “Commas matter bro,” one person wrote, while another replied, “Thanks @elonmusk lol Near disaster averted!!!!!.” A third added: “Good save! Rodgers won’t even know.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Rodgers, 39, suffered an ankle injury after being sacked by Bills edge rusher <strong>Leonard Floyd</strong> during Monday’s game, <a href=#>which marked his debut</a> with the New York team. Rodgers was attended to on the field at MetLife Stadium before being helped off by medical staff.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While X-rays later revealed no broken bones, Rodgers was replaced by backup QB <strong>Zach Wilson</strong> for the rest of the night and it remains unknown when he will be able to rejoin the team.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Prior to Monday’s Jets vs. Bills showdown, Rodgers spoke about the importance of manifesting and speaking what one wishes to see into existence.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I visualize [winning the Super Bowl] all the time,” Rodgers said recently, per <a href=#>The Athletic</a>. “That’s part of training your mind and being intentional with your words about the manifestation of those thoughts and goals and dreams into reality. You first have to have that belief. I believe strongly in that. That’s why we talk about it, we don’t shy away from it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1001511246.jpg><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Mahomes, for his part, can relate to Rodgers’ injury. He was dealing with a kneecap dislocation injury <a href=#>when the Chiefs faced off against the Green Bay Packers</a> — Rodgers’ then-team — in 2019.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While the Packers took home the win, the Chiefs defeated them in another regular season match two years later in 2021.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The duo may be rivals in football, but both Rodgers and Mahomes have previously spoken <a href=#>about being good pals off the field</a>. They were featured in several State Farm commercials together in 2019. The following year, Rodgers praised Mahomes for his talent.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I love my buddy and State Farm ally Pat Mahomes,” Rodgers said in an interview with <a href=#>The Ringer</a> in August 2020. “Just the way he plays really reminds me of myself and I say that with the utmost amount of respect and humility just because I love watching him play because he runs around, he makes throws all over the place, he no-look passes and he does it with enough balance between swagger and humility.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Mahomes, for his part, opened up about his dynamic with Rodgers during a press conference in January 2020. When asked about if he goes to Rodgers for guidance, he replied, “I haven’t even thought about that. I might need to. I do have a relationship where I can talk to him and text him and do stuff like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKearKKesKx5zJqfqKWVqHqkuMCroJ%2Bhlah6qbXSZp%2BarJVisLC5zJ6lrWWfo3qirdGopWaqn5m0pr7SZqCnoqWnxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-tom-holland-and-zendaya-s-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Tom Holland And Zendaya's Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-jenner-admits-to-forgetting-how-many-homes-she-owns.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kris Jenner Admits To Forgetting How Many Homes She Owns</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
