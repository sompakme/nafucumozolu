These famous moms have been navigating the trials and tribulations that come with parenthood...and anything else that life throws at them...for over a decade! The series had a spinoff, titled&nbsp;Teen Mom 2,&nbsp;in late 2010. This spinoff introduced a new group of young mothers, one of whom was Kailyn Lowry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since completing&nbsp;nine seasons on&nbsp;Teen Mom 2, Kailyn has given us a personal look into her life. She is a mother of three sons, from three different "baby daddies."</p><p>In this article, we will&nbsp;take a closer look at&nbsp;all the relationships and romantic links she has had throughout the history of the show. While some of them&nbsp;lasted longer than others, none were short on drama. Stick around until the end of the list&nbsp;â€” some tea wasn't spilled on the show, so there are surprising facts to discover!</p><h2 id=it-all-begins-with-16-and-pregnant><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>It All&nbsp;Begins With '16 And Pregnant'</span></h2><p>In 2010, Kailyn was cast in the second season of MTV's&nbsp;16 and Pregnant. We were introduced to a pregnant, 16-year-old Kailyn. She was expecting a child with her high school sweetheart, Jo Rivera. The new parents welcomed a son to the world, and they named their baby Isaac Rivera. We watched Isaac grow up on&nbsp;Teen Mom 2, right in front of our eyes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kailyn-s-relationship-with-jo-rivera-goes-through-a-lot-of-ups-and-downs><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Kailyn's Relationship With Jo Rivera&nbsp;Goes Through A Lot Of Ups And Downs</span></h2><p>After Isaac's birth, Kailyn and Jo begin experiencing relationship strain, from the stress of adjusting to being new parents. It all proved to be too much because it led the pair to go their separate ways. While they were no longer a couple, they still co-parented for the sake of their son.</p><h2 id=after-her-relationship-with-jo-ends-kailyn-begins-dating-jordan-wenner><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>After Her Relationship With Jo Ends, Kailyn Begins Dating Jordan Wenner</span></h2><p>Shortly after her relationship with Jo ended, Kailyn began dating her co-worker at the time, Jordan Wenner. Kailyn dated Jordan for nearly a year before the pair called it quits.</p><p>One reason things didn't work out with Jordan was the fact that he became caught up in the attention that the show was getting. He got into fame and lost sight of what was more important - their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Embarrassing Times The Teen Moms Forgot The Cameras Were Around</a></span></p><h2 id=kailyn-and-jo-rekindle-their-romance><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Kailyn And Jo Rekindle Their Romance</span></h2><p>Years later, Kailyn came clean and confessed to her fans that another reason why her relationship with Jordan&nbsp;abruptly ended&nbsp;was that she cheated on him with her ex, Jo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kailyn and Jo's rekindled romance was short-lived&nbsp;and ended with both admitting that it was a bad idea...nonetheless, the pair were on good terms.</p><h2 id=kailyn-meets-javi-marroquin-and-shortly-after-ties-the-knot><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Kailyn Meets Javi Marroquin And Shortly After Ties The Knot</span></h2><p>In 2012, Kailyn confirms her relationship with Javi Marroquin, whom she met while working at a mall. The sparks seemed to fly instantly for these two lovebirds and it wasn't long before they decided to tie the knot in a private ceremony.</p><p>Later, they married once again, in front of MTV cameras, This was fun for her fans to see.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Cringe Photos The Teen Moms Don't Want Us To See Of Their Husbands & Boyfriends</a></span></p><h2 id=kailyn-and-javi-welcome-a-child-together><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kailyn And Javi Welcome A Child Together</span></h2><p>There was no hiding this news from her fans - her growing baby bump was hard to miss! In 2013,&nbsp;the family of three became a family of four, with the birth of Kailyn and Javi's son, Lincoln. We saw on the show that Kailyn's first son, Isaac, was very happy about becoming a big brother for the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-seemingly-perfect-marriage-soon-begins-to-fall-apart><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Their Seemingly Perfect Marriage Soon Begins To Fall Apart</span></h2><p>A few years into their marriage, Javi was deployed out of the country for military service. We saw on the show that the long-distance thing proved challenging for Kailyn. She felt like a single mother raising two children alone. This led to Kailyn and Javi's divorce after three years of marriage.</p><h2 id=rumours-of-a-relationship-between-kailyn-and-her-friend-becky-hayter-emerge-during-her-marriage-to-javi><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rumours Of A Relationship&nbsp;Between Kailyn And Her Friend, Becky Hayter, Emerge During Her&nbsp;Marriage&nbsp;To Javi</span></h2><p>These rumors proved to be partially true, as Kailyn admitted to hooking up with Becky during her relationship with Javi, but&nbsp;later claimed that it wasn't serious. She said it was all in good fun.</p><p>Kailyn's struggle with determining her sexuality was also said to have caused rifts in her marriage.</p><h2 id=kailyn-becomes-romantically-linked-to-chris-lopez><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kailyn Becomes Romantically Linked To Chris Lopez</span></h2><p>Not long after her divorce from Javi, Kailyn began dating a classmate from Delaware State College. Fans were shocked when Kailyn&nbsp;announced her pregnancy with baby number three...and chose to keep the identity of the father private. She later revealed that the father of her son, Lux, was Chris Lopez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=during-a-break-from-her-relationship-with-chris-kailyn-introduces-dominique-dom-potter-as-her-girlfriend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>During A Break From Her Relationship With Chris, Kailyn Introduces Dominique 'Dom' Potter As Her Girlfriend</span></h2><p>If you're having trouble keeping up, get ready - it's about to get a lot messier!&nbsp;In 2018, Kailyn introduced her new girlfriend, Dom Potter. The friends-turned-lovers seemed to be very close during the show. Dom regularly joined family outings and&nbsp;spent quality time with Kailyn's three kids.</p><h2 id=the-two-seem-to-have-a-lot-of-fun-together-but-their-relationship-is-short-lived><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Two Seem To Have A Lot Of Fun Together, But Their Relationship Is Short-Lived</span></h2><p>Things took a turn for the worse and the pair parted ways. It wasn't clear why at first, but Dom <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't hold back when it came to throwing shade</a> Kailyn's way on Twitter. Fans weren't kept in the dark for too long, though. It was revealed in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Teen Mom 2 aftershow that Kailyn cheated on Dom with Javi.</p><h2 id=kailyn-is-seen-once-again-with-her-on-again-off-again-boyfriend-chris><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kailyn Is Seen Once Again With Her On-Again Off-Again Boyfriend Chris</span></h2><p>These two sure can't stay away from one another! Here, we see Kailyn and&nbsp;Chris getting cozy for a picture at a baseball game. On the show, we see their co-parenting struggles. There were some concerns about Chris's involvement in his son's life.&nbsp;Fans were worried about what this meant for the family's future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=despite-their-shaky-relationship-they-are-always-there-for-their-son><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Despite Their Shaky Relationship, They Are Always There For Their Son</span></h2><p>Although&nbsp;Kailyn and Chris are still working on their relationship, one thing is for sure - Lux and his happiness always come first!
