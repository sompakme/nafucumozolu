His activities led to his nickname ‘The Prime Minister of the Underworld.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frank Costello Initial Crime</h2><p>At the age of 13, Frank Costello committed several petty crimes. He served short jail terms for assault and robbery between 1912 and 1918.</p><p>He married Lauretta Giegerman in 1918.&nbsp;</p><p>He served a ten-month jail term for carrying a weapon illegally during the same year. After his jail term, he decided to change his crime tactics. Instead of using a gun to commit his crimes, Costello used his brain. His new tactic proved to be a success. He claimed not to have carried a gun and never returned to jail for 37 years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Partnership with Luciano</h2><p>The two Italian criminals, Frank Costello and Luciano, met when each was leading their gangs. The two became friends before they became partners in crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite most of Luciano’s team disapproving of the partnership, the two formed a formidable duo. They made deals involving huge commercial gains with the renowned Jewish criminals of that era.</p><p>The two Italians found themselves on the wrong side of the law in 1926 after they faced bribing charges. Dwyer, a Jewish criminal, was found guilty and served a two years jail term. Costello, however, got away with the crime.</p><p>Frank Costello took over the operations of both gangs. However, this situation did not go well with some of Dwyer’s lieutenants.</p><p>The New York Underworld later destroyed the partnership of Costello-Madden-Schultz. Despite this setback, Costello’s influence continued through the 1920s.</p><p>His way of doing <a href=#>business</a> and associating with the New York criminals led to his famous nickname ‘Prime Minister of the Underworld.’ He associated with the politicians, criminals, judges, cops, and anyone who they felt could stand in their way of criminal activities.</p><p>By 1940, Frank Costello controlled New York politics through the Democratic Party. During his apex rise to power, reports emerged that Costello earned his fortune as a crime czar.</p><p>After his release from jail in 1917, he fell in love with a close friend’s sister, Lauretta Giegerman, and married her in 1918. They had no children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frank Costello’s Downfall</h2><p>Frank Costello’s ability to sanctify his name in the public eye ended after a Senate hearing mentioned Costello as the country’s leading racketeer. His testimony would later worsen things for him. Some of the charges facing him were tax evasion and contempt of court.</p><p>In 1957, Costello escaped Death by a whisker when a bullet intended to kill him slightly hit his scalp. Genovese later made peace with Costello despite being responsible for Costello’s attempted murder. His rank in the gang family reduced tremendously from a top-level boss to an ordinary soldier within the family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Later life of Frank Costello</h2><p>During the final stage of his life, Frank Costello regularly advised mafia bosses on various issues. He retained the title ‘The Prime Minister of the Underworld’ The Supreme Court of the US upheld a decision of a lower court seeking the deportation of Costello on 20th February 1961.</p><p>Three years after making the decision, the same court held his deportation. The court process became null and void after Costello’s Death.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Death of Frank Costello</h2><p>Frank Costello suffered a heart attack in February 1973. An effort by the doctors at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan to save his life proved to be futile. The Prime Minister of the underworld died on 18th February 1973. Costello’s body is laid down at Saint Michael’s Cemetery.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCy0ZqlpGWTpMC1sculpmarpKS%2Funs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabriela-bee-youtuber-wikipedia-biography-age-height-weight-measurements-boyfriend-net-wort.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gabriela Bee (Youtuber) Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Measurements, Boyfriend, Net Wort</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-oprah-winfrey-still-own-part-of-weight-watchers-after-losing-around-117-million-of-her-net-wor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Oprah Winfrey Still Own Part Of Weight Watchers After Losing Around $117 Million Of Her Net Wor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
