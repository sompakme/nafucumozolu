I’m not married. I have never been married,” Davis, 58, said during the Monday, July 10, episode of the “<a href=#>Best Friend Energy</a>” podcast. “It’s not my thing. I was never focused on it. It was never a goal, let’s say.”</p><p>Although Davis feels that <a href=#>the “real essence” of her personality</a> is “the same” as Charlotte, she confessed that it “took some acting” to seamlessly portray a married woman and hopeless romantic on screen. (Single mom Davis adopted her <a href=#>daughter, Gemma, and son, Wilson</a>, in 2011 and 2018, respectively.)</p><p>“I would stress out on those days,” Davis — who played Charlotte on SATC from 1998 to 2004 before reprising the role for <a href=#>And Just Like That</a> in 2021 — recalled. “I would have a paragraph on a page of [the script with] the rules and the marriage [lingo]. <a href=#>And oh, my God</a>, I would just be like, ‘How am I going to do this and make it real and believable?'”</p><p>The <a href=#>actress</a> noted that her upbringing in the South helped her connect with Charlotte’s desire to be a wife above all else. Still, “it definitely took some work in the beginning,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kristin-Davis-Admits-It-Took-Some-Acting-to-Portray-Married-Charlotte-on-Sex-and-the-City-320.jpg><p>During season 3, Charlotte married Trey MacDougal (<a href=#><strong>Kyle MacLachlan</strong></a>) but the pair later divorced. Charlotte moved on with her divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt (<a href=#><strong>Evan Handler</strong></a>), whom she wed during season 6. Charlotte and Harry share two kids.</p><p>“I knew people like that. <a href=#>I knew it was real</a>. Charlotte was didactic. She was 100 percent devoted,” Davis told listeners. “I wanted you to see the need that was underneath that. I loved where it went.”</p><p>She described Charlotte’s first husband as “not perfect” despite his social status and net worth but gushed over “<a href=#>wonderful Harry</a>,” her character’s true match.</p><p>While Davis struggled to perfect Charlotte’s passion for the stereotypical happy ending, she revealed that she did “love” the character’s first wedding.</p><p>“I’m not really a wedding girl but, you know, Charlotte loved it, so I loved it,” she said. “I remember the experience of shooting the wedding. I must have tried on 35 Vera Wang dresses.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kristin-Davis-Admits-It-Took-Some-Acting-to-Portray-Married-Charlotte-on-Sex-and-the-City-321.jpg><p>Charlotte’s <a href=#>final choice of the tulle and lace-adorned gown</a>, however, didn’t align with Davis’ personal style. “The poof one won and it was just, like, such a weird thing because it’s not my thing at all,” she admitted. “I would never wear that dress if I did get married. I would not be wearing that veil. But I was devoted to it.”</p><p><a href=#>And Just Like That</a> airs on Max Thursdays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqarJOoeqy%2ByKyroqZdma63tdJmn5qcXam8bsPOq6JmmaRir6a1zaBkoZmgpbatxYymmKuqmZqxbq%2FHmqmlp6SpsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-most-expensive-jewelry-at-the-2023-met-gala-ranked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Most Expensive Jewelry At The 2023 Met Gala, Ranked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maluma-25-things-you-don-t-know-about-me.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maluma: 25 Things You Dont Know About Me</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
