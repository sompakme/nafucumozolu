As <a href=#>we still process his physical absence</a>, we celebrate his presence,” the&nbsp;<i>One Night in Miami…&nbsp;</i>director, 52, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Friday, January 20, sharing a video of a lantern floating across the evening sky. “We are all in different places on the planet … so is Ian. His spirit is the thread that connects us.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “Of course, orange is your favorite color. It’s the fire and the calm. I see you in everything I [breathe]. My absolute favorite thing about myself is being … Regina the mother of Ian the GodKing. Continue to shine bright, my guiding light.&nbsp;<span class=s1>🧡🧡🧡</span>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Regina-King-Honors-Late-Son-Ian-1-Year-After-His-Death-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>The late musician — who the<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Watchman</a>&nbsp;</i>alum shared with ex-husband<strong> Ian Alexander Sr.</strong> — <a href=#>died by suicide</a> on January 21, 2022, at the age of 26.</p><p class=p1>“Our family is devastated at the deepest level by the loss of Ian,” King <a href=#>told <i>Today</i>&nbsp;in a statement at the time</a>. “He is such a bright light who cared so deeply about the happiness of others. Our family asks for respectful consideration during this private time. Thank you.”</p><p class=p1>Following Ian’s death, the Oscar winner <a href=#>has been supported by her famous friends</a> as she grieves the loss of her only child.</p><p class=p1>“My friend. I think of you often. I always pray for your strength & peace in the midst of loss and grief.

You may say you do, but if you don’t have a child, you don’t know what that is. But when you experience it, it is the most fulfilling ever. So, that is the greatest part about me. Being a mom to Ian.”</p><p class=p1>The late “Work It Out” singer, who <a href=#>performed under the stage name</a> Desduné, was equally proud that King was his mother.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Happy birthday&nbsp;to my co, so extremely proud of you and inspired by your love, artistry, and gangsta! To be able to watch you take this lifetime by its neck and make it yours is something I will forever be grateful for,” Ian wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in January 2021, sharing a sweet birthday tribute to the actress. “But to have you as my mother is the greatest gift I could ask for. To be all that you are while always having the time to be there, love and support me unconditionally is truly remarkable. The whole marvel universe ain’t got s—t on you, [you’re] the real superhero! Love you mom!
