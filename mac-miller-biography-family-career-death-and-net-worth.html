Miller had a studio called Blue Slide Park, which reached to the number-one on the US Billboard 200, the first independently distributed debut album to top the chart since 1995.</strong><span id=more-1112979></span></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span></p><p>In early 2013, Mac Miller launched his own record label imprint, Remember Music. On June 18, 2013, he launched his 2nd album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off (his album that was released June 18, 2013, by Rostrum Records) and just after the launch, Miller left Rostrum and signed a record deal with the major label Warner Bros. Records on October 2014, where he released 3 studio albums: GO: OD AM of 2015, The Divine Feminine of 2016), and Swimming of 2018.</p><p>Moreover, he also served as a record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman, producing music for SZA, Vince Staples, Lil B, Ab-Soul, Riff Raff, Smoke DZA, and himself. Mac Miller was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards for Swimming.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-medrectangle-4></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-4 medrectangle-4340 adtester-container adtester-container-340" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-medrectangle-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-medrectangle-4-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;width:100%;max-width:1200px;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>Miller’s career started way back when he was 6 years when he played piano, guitar, drums, and bass. Miller wanted to be a singer, but at the age of 14, he started rapping. When he was in high school he focused on his hip hop career. He said, “Once I hit 15, I got really serious about it and it changed my life completely … I used to be into sports, play all the sports, go to all the high school parties. But once I found out hip-hop is almost like a job, that’s all I did.” Initially, his name was Easy Mac.</p><p>He released the mixtape But My Mackin’ Ain’t Easy in 2007 at the age of 15 and by 2009, he established himself as Mac Miller and released 2 mixtapes: The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown and The High Life. One year later, he won 21 & Under of the Year, and Best Hip Hop Video for “Live Free”.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-box-4></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 box-4 box-4260 adtester-container adtester-container-260" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-box-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-box-4-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;width:100%;max-width:1200px;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>He signed with the independent label Rostrum Records in July 2010, in the lead-up to his mixtape K.I.D.S. The Rostrum president Benjy Grinberg met Miller while recording with Wiz Khalifa at ID Labs. Grinberg gave Miller advice but he did not show interest in getting involved with his career until Miller began working on K.I.D.S., when, as he told HitQuarters, “noticed a maturation in his sound and approach to his music.”</p><p>By that time, Miller started attracting interest from different record companies but chose Rostrum due to its location in his hometown and association with Wiz Khalifa. The mixtape, K.I.D.S. was inspired by the film Kids of 1995. Getting to February 2011, Miller was one of eleven rappers featured in XXL’s annual “Freshman Class” list of that year and in March the same year, Miller released his 5th mixtape, Best Day Ever, which featured mainstream producers: Just Blaze, 9th Wonder and Chuck Inglish of The Cool Kids.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-leader-2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-2 leader-2701 adtester-container adtester-container-701" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-2><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-2-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;width:100%;max-width:1200px;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>The single “Donald Trump” became his 1st song to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 75, and is his most-viewed music video on YouTube with over 159 million views as of December 2018. Miller’s 6th track came in, on March 2011, On and On and Beyond, produced by Rostrum. In mid-2011, his 1st TV appearance was in the VH1 show Single Ladies; he played a fictionalized version of himself that succeeded in selling one of his mixtapes to one of the main characters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mac-miller-age></span>Mac Miller Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mac Miller’s sunrise was in 1992 while his sunset was 2018.

He is the son of Karen Meyers (Jewish) and Mark McCormick (Christian), both of whom are photographer and architect respectively. Miller was raised Jewish and he celebrated the Jewish High Holy Days.
