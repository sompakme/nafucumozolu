He had several spotlight moments, and one of those was the hilarious season 17 finale of Keeping Up With The Kardashians when Khloé Kardashian impersonated her mother, Kris. The Good American founder was filmed calling him several times, alluding to how Kris always wanted him to be on call. However, what have the famous TV family's former assistants said about them regarding work ethics and all that it entails to be on the Kardashian-Jenner payroll?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-kris-jenner-39-s-former-assistants-say-about-her-work-ethics><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Did Kris Jenner's Former Assistants Say About Her Work Ethics?</span></h2><h3 id=kris-jenner-39-s-former-assistant-pam-behan-said-she-tended-to-flip-out-when-things-didn-39-t-go-her-way>Kris Jenner's former assistant, Pam Behan, said she tended to flip out when things didn't go her way.</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kris-jenner-looking-confident.jpg><p>The ever-efficient momager has several personal and executive assistants who work with her to run the day-to-day affairs of her family's business empire. Over the years, Kris Jenner has proven to be reality TV gold and a business mogul who knows how to stay trending. It is safe to say that thanks to her selection of assistants, she has been able to successfully execute goals to keep the family business afloat.</p><p>Like every boss, the TV star has a set of rules she expects her staff to follow by the book, and if an assistant is found wanting, they will definitely face the consequences. She once confirmed this to HuffPost in 2018, noting that a breach of privacy will not go unpunished, even if the person was not financially buoyant. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Jenner revealed</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't care how much money somebody might have.

Behan relayed that she could also get increasingly temperamental if things don't go Kris Jenner's way in the slightest form.</p><p>On TikTok, a user named Madeline Steiz went viral after making a short-form clip detailing her work experience with Kris Jenner. Steiz alleged that she would often have nightmares about the Kardashian-Jenner family because she was consumed by work. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steiz clarified that working with the matriarch was not horrible</a>, and being absorbed by the job was an aspect of it all.

The star is a mom to two young kids, and she also reportedly takes care of her niece, Dream Kardashian. Alexa Brenman, one of Khloé's well-known and closest personal assistants, has worked with her since 2015. Brenman made appearances on KUWTK, and from their rapport, it appeared like the duo were close.</p><p>However, not all the media personality's employees moved up the friendship ladder. In February 2023, Matthew Manhard, who worked for Khloé Kardashian from 2019 to 2022, filed a lawsuit alleging that she fired him unjustly. In documents obtained by TMZ, Manhard also highlighted the unfavorable working conditions he experienced, noting that Khloe avoided paying him overtime when he worked 12-hour days. He also alleged that he was often busy with tasks such that he sometimes could not take the allotted breaks.</p><p><strong>What insiders have said about Khloé Kardashian's work ethics, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Life & Style</a>:</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Khloé Kardashian bridges the employee-boss gap.</strong></li><li><strong>Khloé Kardashian treats her staff like an extended family.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=what-have-kourtney-kardashian-39-s-past-assistants-said-about-working-for-her><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Have Kourtney Kardashian's Past Assistants Said About Working For Her?</span></h2><h3 id=kourtney-kardashian-39-s-former-nanny-leah-barr-said-that-her-job-was-not-the-regular-nanny-job>Kourtney Kardashian's former nanny, Leah Barr, said that her job was not the regular nanny job.</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kourtney-kardashian-1.jpg><p>Former executive assistant Elizabeth Muller appears to have a relatively conducive work environment with Kourtney Kardashian until it's time for the big star-studded events. Muller alluded to this in 2022 when Kourtney attended the Met gala for the first time with her spouse, Travis Barker. Per The Sun, Muller posted a hilarious Twitter (X) from AssitantsvsAents, which read:</p><p>" For every Met Gala look, there is an assistant who just had the worst month of their life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Muller appeared to have resonated with the tweet but clarified that it was on a light note as she addressed Kourtney, "Just kidding, love you, Kourtney. It's all worth it." Kourtney Kardashian's former nanny, Leah Barr, appeared to share a similar sentiment about the great working conditions when she opened up about leaving the Poosh founder's employ. Leah Barr clarified that there were no issues as she was ready to move up in her career. She described working for the mom-of-three as "some of the best years" of her life. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barr noted on TikTok:</a></p><p>"Those were some of the best years of my life working for them.

She described her job outline as time-consuming and unlike any nanny job. The young adult, however, revealed that she was grateful for all she had learned from Kourtney. In the past, the reality star has been in the news for how she constantly changed nannies.</p><p>It appears the TV personality loves to define her professional relationship with her household staff. Per the U.S. Sun, an ex-nanny for Kourtney Kardashian's kids revealed that the star demanded that she be called "madam" at all times. The former caregiver said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she once made the mistake of calling Kourtney by her name</a>, and it was not well-received.

According to a Life & Style insider, Kim is in the habit of dashing out luxury items she no longer needs, or re-gifting expensive jewelry. The insider described her as a great employer who works a lot. The implication is that her nannies work very long hours as well.

From her explanation, one could deduce that the makeup mogul applied a level of patience with her workers. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Villarroel recalled via YouTub</a>e:</p><p>"She looked at me, and she told me something, and I couldn't understand!

I got really frustrated… And then she looked at me and was like 'No, never mind..."</p><p>Victoria Villarroel, who is now an influencer with a large Instagram following, summed up working for Kylie Jenner as fun. The pair got so close that Kylie even shared her "deepest secrets" with Villarroel.
