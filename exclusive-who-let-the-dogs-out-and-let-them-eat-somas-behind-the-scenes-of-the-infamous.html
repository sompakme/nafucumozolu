Well, if we’re going to be honest here, the view of any idea is 100% subjective based on the eye of the one who’s analyzing it. The truth is, if I thought an idea I came up with was indeed a “bad” idea, then I never would have allowed it to see the light of day.&nbsp;</p><p>Any of my ideas that made it to air were based on me thinking it was a “good” idea. Therefore, if I thought it was a “good” idea then . . . I would still think it’s a good idea now. Make sense? So, the perception of me not owning up to any of&nbsp; my “bad” ideas is somewhat of a slippery slope because a) it’s your “opinion” that the idea is bad, b) if I didn’t think the idea was “bad” then, I’m not going to think it’s bad now, and c) for the vast majority, I honestly don’t remember many of my ideas – bad OR good – being that I had to create so many, in so little time, in an effort to fill multiple hours of program a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, I remember the big events; <a href=#>Steve Austin</a> driving the beer truck, “This is your life, Rock”, <a href=#>The Rock</a> joining the Corporation, Arquette as World Champ, etc., but you’d be shocked if you knew the number of conversations I’ve had with fans and colleges over the years where they tell me about a story that I wrote years and years ago, and in all honesty, I don’t remember.&nbsp;</p><p>For the record, I do remember that the abduction of Samoa Joe by a van full of ninjas was NOT mine, but aside from that, it’s hit or miss.</p><p>With the exception of this one time, of course.</p><p>I “do” remember the months building up the feud between Al Snow and the Big Boss Man. Maybe because everything that I ever did with Al was so memorable based on his uniqueness and genius, or maybe because of the fond memories I have in working with the late Ray Traylor. Maybe a little of both, but regardless, I remember a lot when it comes to the crooked cop feeding the petite dog, Pepper, to his unsuspecting nemesis Mr. Snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Now what I don’t remember is the way the series of events took place. Did Al eat Pepper prior to the booking of Vince Russo’s “worst idea in the history of pro wrestling”, or did the meal come after? I know the two had a memorable brawl in an apartment after Al chowed down on puppy pate, but again, not sure if that was before Russo’s raging debacle. Anyway, that is all now a buried bone. What came in what order doesn’t matter, but what does have some memorable significance is the “Dog Kennel From Hell Match”, which was INDEED THAT, in every aspect of the phrase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZp6cmam8s7XApapobWJrhHp9jJ2moGWbmruvsctmnaunnWK1prjLZqSarJOdeqawyK2mq6GRoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-ap-rocky-apologizes-to-jason-collins-for-awkward-vma-sideeye.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A$AP Rocky Apologizes To Jason Collins For Awkward VMA Sideeye</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-larry-king-s-net-worth-and-estate-caused-so-much-controversy-when-he-died.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Larry Kings Net Worth And Estate Caused So Much Controversy When He Died</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
