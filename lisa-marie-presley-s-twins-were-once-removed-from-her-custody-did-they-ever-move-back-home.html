When she married Michael Lockwood, it appeared as though this marriage might go the distance, especially as the 10-year anniversary neared. It was right around that time though that Presley filed for divorce from Lockwood as a result of "irreconcilable differences." But unlike the other divorces that Presley went through, this one would turn ugly and last for years. Perhaps worst of all, however, the former couple's children would be involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The divorce paperwork was filed in 2016. During this time, allegations were tossed back and forth between Presley and Lockwood. Amidst these allegations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">astronomical financial support was requested by Lockwood</a>. And in response, Presley said that she could not afford any financial support given the "misappropriation" of her <a href=#>once hefty wealth</a> by both Lockwood and a "former business manager."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Remembering Lisa Marie Presley, The Life Of Elvis Presley's Daughter</a></span></p><p>After it was determined that a postnuptial agreement signed in 2007 was deemed valid, Presley was off the hook for paying Lockwood anything. But the mudslinging just got worse the longer the divorce went on. And in 2017, it all came to a head when Presley made horrifying allegations against Lockwood that would ultimately take their children, Finley and Harper, away from both parents until a proper investigation could be completed and it was determined there was a safe place for the twin girls to live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here is information as to why Lisa Marie Presley's twins were removed from her custody and whether they were ever returned.</p><h2 id=finley-and-harper-lockwood-were-taken-into-dcfs-custody>Finley And Harper Lockwood Were Taken Into DCFS Custody</h2><p>Just when the press did not think that the divorce between Presley and Lockwood could not get any worse, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a bombshell was dropped by Presley.</a> And it was one that would start a chain of events that Elvis Presley's only child never saw coming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar48693003-1.jpg><p>In 2017, Presley's legal team filed documents that stated Presley was contesting Lockwood's request for spousal support given the "disturbing photos and videos of children on his computer." A shocking claim that then had to be investigated to determine if true or false.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Presley claimed Lockwood had "hundreds of inappropriate photos of children." He was also "facing allegations of sexual abuse and neglect."</p><p>These claims caused the Department of Children and Family Services to get involved.

All of which Priscilla said that she came to "value very much."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look Inside Lisa Marie Presley's Childhood</a></span></p><p>The twins were allowed to see both of their parents while remaining in the care of Priscilla.

She also was cleared of any abuse claims lauded against her. As such, joint custody was awarded to both parents.</p><p>The custody initially was broken down so that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Presley had physical custody of the girls and Lockwood had supervised visits with them three days per week</a>.</p><p>As battling continued in court, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custody agreement was eventually changed</a> so that Presley had the girls 60 percent of the time and Lockwood had them 40 percent of the time.</p><p>At the time of her death, Finley and Harper were living with Presley. It is now rumored that Lockwood will be filing for full custody of the girls.
