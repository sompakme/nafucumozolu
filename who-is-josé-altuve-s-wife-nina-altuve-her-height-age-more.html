Nina grew up with her two siblings, Alfredo David and Justo Emilio, and her parents and belongs to Venezuelan nationality.</p><p>Unfortunately, Altuve’s elementary and high school education information is unavailable. However, she received her higher education at the University of Carabobo, Venezuela, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Bioanalytics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nina-Altuve-Age-819x1024.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=professional-career><span id=Professional_Career><strong>Professional Career</strong></span></h3><p>Speaking about her professional career, Nina is a skilled bio analyst who prefers to avoid all media attention. Because of this very reason, unfortunately, there is little to no information about where Erin works and what cases she handles as a bio analyst. It is also true that her professional career is often overshadowed because of her fame through her husband. Although there is no information on whether Nina started her professional career as a bio analyst right after graduating, she got her bioanalytics degree from one of the prestigious universities of Venezuela.</p><p>So, Nina may be helping the research departments to enhance their expertise on living organisms and natural resources management, which is what bio analysts do. Hence, Nina is more engaged in her mother’s duties than her job as a bio analyst because of her devotion to her children and family.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=relationship-status><span id=Relationship_Status><strong>Relationship Status</strong></span></h3><p>Regarding her relationship status, Nina is a happily married woman who met her husband, José Altuve, when she was still in high school. Nina was head over heels for being with José, and he believed their love was confirmed when they were dating at such a young age. Because of this very reason, they decided to make their relationship permanent even before graduating from high school and tied their wedding knot when Nina was just 14 years old while José was a 16-year-old boy.</p><p>Nina and José decided to take their relationship to the next level after marrying all these years and welcoming their first child, Melanie A. Altuve, in October 2016 after the announcement of Nina being pregnant that same year. She lives with her family in a Houston house, which they moved to around 2020.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=height-weight-and-physical-appearances><span id=Height_Weight_and_Physical_Appearances><strong>Height, Weight, and Physical Appearances</strong></span></h3><p>Nina is 5 feet 4 inches tall, and her weight is unavailable. Altuve is a gorgeous lady with dark brown hair and black eyes looking at her pictures.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=net-worth><span id=Net_worth><strong>Net worth</strong></span></h3><p>Nina Altuve’s net worth is unknown because her professional career and work are still unknown but yet to be verified. On the other hand, she must be busy with her daughter and enjoying her husband’s net worth.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=social-media><span id=Social_media><strong>Social media</strong></span></h3><p>Nina appears inactive on social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, even being a famous player’s wife. Her Instagram account, @neenaa27, is also private.
