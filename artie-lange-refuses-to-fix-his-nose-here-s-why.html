It sounded scary and is an example of the difficult times that he has had in his life. He said that he was supposed to pay $62,000 to a bookie and a 19-year-old "kidnapped" him and wanted $100,000. Lange said that he told him “You’re just a kid, like, this was a dumb plan." He added, "Like, I actually felt bad for him and he got kind of scared and he left.

In December 2018, Page Six reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the star tweeted a picture of his face</a> and fans were able to see that his nose looked like it was in bad shape.

It can be really tough to be vulnerable in a therapy session.</p><p>But talking to someone is definitely helpful when it comes to processing tough feelings and getting through challenging moments in life. He said that in the past, therapists hadn't helped him, but that changed. Lange explained:</p><p>"Everyone who knows anything about therapy, they tell you that if you're not being honest with them, you're not going to get any help, you're wasting your time. It has never been effective for me, therapy. This is the longest I've tried it.

It's hard to find information about any further tour dates, but it's possible that Lange took a break after that because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlr%2B1tcRmo5qml5p6s7HFrqqeq12pvG6yyLFkoaGjYruwv8Ro</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-bernanke-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Bernanke Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./90-day-fianc%C3%A9-s-paul-staehle-isn-t-dead-blames-phone-and-boat-issues-for-disappearance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>90 Day Fiancs Paul Staehle Isnt Dead, Blames Phone and Boat Issues for Disappearance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
