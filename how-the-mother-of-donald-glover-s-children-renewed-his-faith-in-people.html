I mean I don’t dream as much, I just miss dreaming! I think my partner, she does all the hard stuff, to be honest. She’s just very supportive. I haven’t really had to change anything.

It gives me a lot of context.”</p><p>On a couple of occasions when Glover has won awards, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has taken the opportunity to praise White</a>. When Glover won Outstanding Actor In A Comedy at the 2017 Emmys, he thanked White and his kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I want to thank Michelle, my partner.
