Douglas told investigators that they thought they spotted someone who looked like rapper DaBaby and took several glances to see if it was really him.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Douglas told police that Kirk initiated the conversation and seemed intent on creating an issue. He said Kirk wanted to go outside to the parking lot to fight, and when they were planning to leave, Kirk launched at Douglas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/euQKwLB7EKJ65Q21TtzVsuS9rb0=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/cmg/4RILHGGFHRHVZCB6JMYNPYHLBQ.jpg"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">In the surveillance video, Kirk can be seen hitting Douglas in the head and nearly tackling him to the ground. Kirk and Douglas then start fighting, while Craig was seen standing nearby.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Craig reaches into the front of his waistband to pull out what appears to be a firearm,” according to a death-investigation report prepared by Mecklenburg County Assistant District Attorney William Bunting.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The report then said Craig attempted to pull them off from one another, when Kirk’s partner at the time interjected herself in the fight and tried to separate Kirk and Douglas.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> reviewed additional footage that was not published. According to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Kirk’s partner pushed Craig back and Kirk was able to break free one his hands. He then pulled out a gun and shot Craig in his side. Craig collapsed at the other end of the aisle.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">DaBaby’s lawyers, Drew Findling and Marissa Goldberg, <a href=#>told TMZ</a> prosecutors reviewed the video in 2018 and determined the rapper acted in self-defense.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Witnesses were interviewed and corroborated Mr. Kirk’s statement. The entirety of the surveillance video was viewed and determined to corroborate Mr. Kirk’s statement,” the lawyers told TMZ in part. “Mr. Kirk was protecting himself and his family at the time of the shooting.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Channel 9 has reached out to DaBaby’s lawyers for a full statement on the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/_U8-tm-fsklUmQrLeuhmgEunwcg=/1440x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/cmg/6BJGFCBERZCOHOLUC5VTWD26CI.png"><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">For Craig’s family, the video raises some new questions surrounding the incident.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I feel like they just swept it up under the rug,” Craig’s mother, LaWanda Horsley, told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> of the investigation into her son’s death. “[Kirk] knows what he did. I’m not doing this for no fame or anything, because at the end of the day, Jaylin Craig is gone.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Craig’s family told Rolling Stone that the fight only started when Kirk became annoyed that people recognized him and allegedly demanded they take things outside for a fight.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I don’t look at him as no DaBaby,” Horsley says. “I look at him like, ‘You’re Jonathan Kirk and you murdered Jaylin Craig.’”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Kirk was charged with carrying a concealed gun in the case, and he was sentenced to 30 days in the Mecklenburg County Jail. The district attorney’s office said “that sentence was suspended pending his successful completion of 12 months of unsupervised probation.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Kirk did not face any additional charges in the case.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><b>Statement from the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s Office:</b></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><i>“In June 2019, Mr. Kirk was tried for misdemeanor carrying a concealed gun (in connection with the death of Jaylin Craig) in Mecklenburg County District Court before a judge. The judge found him guilty of that offense. He was sentenced to 30 days in the Mecklenburg County Jail; that sentence was suspended pending his successful completion of 12 months of unsupervised probation. The District Attorney’s Office reviewed the police investigative file and agreed with the Huntersville Police Department’s decision not to charge Mr. Kirk further as prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.”</i></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Horsley -- who still lives in Charlotte -- and other family members believe Craig’s killing was unjustified. She told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> that DaBaby destroyed their family, and that it took all these years before anyone came to them asking for their side of the story.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“We never hid from nobody,” she said. “We never [heard] from nobody. Y’all knew our names from a news clip. But nobody ever asked us what was Jaylin like. Nobody.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Craig’s family are also sickened to watch Kirk seemingly launch a career off the back of their son’s death, <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> reports.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“This is stressing me out right now because every time you turn on the radio, you hear him,” Craig’s father, Curtis, said. “You can’t even listen to the radio. I think about my son constantly.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Rapper DaBaby has been involved in altercations and violence multiple times. In April 2022, he was at his home in Troutman when a person was shot on his property.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Police have not confirmed who shot the person, but DaBaby posted on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>, seeming to claim responsibility for the shooting.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><i><b>(WATCH BELOW: Rapper DaBaby addresses Troutman property shooting on social media)</b></i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/jTc17YXw0j5GTB_65Sy1AFU2CUk=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/04-15-2022/t_6b8c925cabe740c1ad67fe75853276fb_name_df_5pm_troutman_shooting_dababy_pkg_153723_frame_252.jpeg"><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 gAFIWJ image-metadata"><span class=title>Rapper DaBaby addresses Troutman property shooting on social media</span></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">©2022 Cox Media Group</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te82ermaumZmysHnSoaawq12ivK6xza2qZqSVlrGqusZmrKlllJqupbjYZmlpaWhixKK4zJqprWWjnbywwMinnmahnqu8rcLIp55mqpGlvaa%2BjJ2Ym5mSrnx2f7KLjYJ8eISChJW3gZBtfYd9mZaTq5GFgmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-eric-dane-s-net-worth-in-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Eric Dane's Net Worth In 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miraa-may-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-baby-songs-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miraa May Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Baby, Songs and Net Worth.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
