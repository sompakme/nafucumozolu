Curry was fortunate enough to be born with a background basketball championship. <a href=#>His father, Dell Curry,</a> and his brother Seth Curry are well-known basketball players too. But Stephen took his family’s basketball legacy further than anybody else could.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went through a drastic change in his income rate after 2007 and is today among the highest-paid sportspersons in the world of basketball. His net worth is estimated to be around $130 million. Steph Curry is known to be the first from the NBA to sign a super-max contract with the Golden State Warriors. This 2017 contract got him his five-year extension and a deal of about $201 million.</p><p>It might sound like a lot of money, but Stephen Curry has proved his worth time and again. He had a deal of $3 million per season with the Golden State Warriors, and he made an average of $2.5 million every season, starting from the rookie season till the fourth one. Going by his impressive stats, he might as well earn about 257 million by the time his contract expires.</p><p>Speculations suggest that Stephen Curry’s financial boom is because of his healthy perspective on money. He believes in minding his own business, quite literally, instead of comparing his contemporaries’ success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following are ways in which the NBA star spends his millions.</p><h2 id=curry-s-career-as-a-movie-producer>Curry’s Career As A Movie Producer</h2><p>Curry began his career as a movie producer in 2018 after teaming up with Geron Smith and Eric Payton. He founded his <a href=#>production company</a> called Unanimous Media with his business partners. Unanimous Media is known for producing movies with sports, faith, and family as their thematic base. The production company got into a profitable deal with Sony Pictures and started producing successful movie rates rapidly.</p><p>Unanimous Media is also known to have produced <i>‘Holy Moly,’</i> a mini-game that is golf-themed. Curry used his fame to popularize this show by participating in it. Curry’s production company also made <i>‘Stephen Vs. The Game’</i>, a documentary on Curry himself. He spent $14 million producing <i>‘Breakthrough,’</i> which grossed around 50 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=a-luxury-mansion-for-family>A Luxury Mansion For Family</h2><p>Note: not actual photo</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amongst his many luxury properties, Curry lives with his family in his $31 million mansion at Atherton in California. He moved with his wife and kids to this palatial estate in 2019. He might have chosen this location because it is an easy drive to Chase Center.</p><p>But this mansion, too, seems to be perfect as a family hearth. It has three stories and is generous with space as it occupies about 1.2 acres of land. It is also extremely private with all the gadgets surrounding the property and is at the end of a narrow driveway. Some <a href=#>luxury amenities</a> in the house include a swimming pool, barbecue, basketball courts, outdoor fireplace, guest house, and beautiful green gardens.</p><h2 id=a-collection-of-luxury-vehicles>A Collection Of Luxury Vehicles</h2><p>Note: not actual photo</p><p>Curry has enough cars in his collection to drive a different one each day of the week. He might also be the owner of the most number of vehicles in the basketball league. He has a wholesome collection of sports cars and other smart cars which are eco-friendly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Cars In Drake's $12 Million Collection</a></span></p><p>He owns a Tesla X 90 D, which shows that he believes in the smart car tech being developed to improve environmental sustenance. The other luxury cars he owns include a $187,500 Porsche 911 GT3 RS, a $150,000 Porsche Panamera Turbo S, a $352,000 worth Infiniti Q50, and so on. His garage also boasts Cadillac Escalades and many fancy Mercedes Benz models.</p><h2 id=a-condominium>A Condominium</h2><p>Curry and his wife, Aisha, also purchased a condominium in 2019 worth $8 million. This property is in San Francisco. The building is 45 floors, and this condo is on the 30th floor. It occupies about 2,800 square feet of area.</p><p>Aisha Curry owns her restaurant called International Smoke, which is a short distance from this <a href=#>luxury condominium</a>. This stunning property is not only secure but also one of the most extravagant, with several amenities. These include a well-equipped gym, concierge service, generous parking spaces, lounge with bar, huge dining spaces, and marble baths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spending-in-charity>Spending in Charity</h2><p>Curry can inspire his fans to donate money to the needy because he sets the example for it. He <a href=#>spends millions on several noble causes</a>. He is known to have contributed around $82,000 to the global fight against malaria disease. He also makes frequent private donations to help friends who might be going through a bad phase in their lives.</p><p>He has contributed to the Eat, Learn, Play Foundation and an animal rescue foundation. Aisha is a worthy partner in this noble venture, and she accompanied her husband in donating 1 million meals to Oakland for the students there. He contributes to a historically black institution, Howards University, to represent themselves in golf, an initially racist and classist sport.</p><h2 id=a-treasure-trove-of-fancy-watches>A Treasure Trove Of Fancy Watches</h2><p>NBA star Steph Curry has a known fascination for watches. He spends a considerable chunk of his fortune on buying the fanciest watches. Press reports have repeatedly suggested that his elegant watches add to his exclusive fashion sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has a Rolex Sea-Dweller Deep Sea, which cost him about $9,900. There are more on his premium collection, including a Cartier Santos 100 worth about $14,990 and a Gold Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch which cost him about $56,000.</p><p>When it comes to money and fame, Steph Curry is seen to have a symbiotic relationship with the<a href=#> brands he endorses</a>. These include JP Morgan Chase, Britta, Infinity, Fanatics, and most importantly, Under Armour.</p><p>Stephen Curry chose Under Armour over Nike, which has made a significant difference to Under Armour’s brand value. The brand pays him 20 million each year, but the star player is worth it because he scuttles about 14 million their way just by being the face of their brand. Curry is a source of inspiration for sportspeople across the world.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Strange Things The King Of Thailand Spends Millions On</a></span></p><p>Sources -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TheRichest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make it</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportscasting</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAtbHPoWScraKnxm66wZpkrKiVo7GqusZmpKKknJ68r7%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-cudmore-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Cudmore Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-mma-organizations-bought-out-by-ufc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 MMA Organizations Bought Out by UFC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
