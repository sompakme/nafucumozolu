Not only is Kevin starring in the film, but he’s also a director, and apparently sank a lot of his own money into the production.</p><p>The insider claimed that if the project is a hit, Kevin’s friends believe he’ll get a spring back in his step. But if it tanks, it could further impact the actor’s well-being.</p><p>“There’s such a thing as giving TOO MUCH of yourself to a movie project, and that’s what’s happened to Kevin here,” they explained. “Friends worry about Kevin because of the wars he’s been through in the last year and a half: his marriage ending, his fight with the Yellowstone bosses and the monumental battle to get Horizon: An American Saga made.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not only Costner’s huge project that’s apparently taking a toll on him.

Costner, who played the lead role, clashed with Sheridan over the demanding production timelines and his desire to focus on other projects.</p><p>“Everybody has their limits, even somebody as self-reliant as Kevin, and you can see how hard he’s pushed himself when you spend a little time with him in person. His plans for this summer are extremely ambitious, but does he really have the energy to execute them?
