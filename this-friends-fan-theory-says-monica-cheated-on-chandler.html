In the case of&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a></strong>, there are some interesting fan theories, from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans never seeing Phoebe's </a>legs to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Ross being cursed</a>. It's a testament to how popular this 90's sitcom still is that people love reading about fan theories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Chandler and Monica are beloved, a fan theory exists that says Monica could have cheated on him. Let's take a look at this theory.</p><h2 id=the-fan-theory>The Fan Theory</h2><p>It's definitely true that when fans think about the most popular pair on&nbsp;Friends, their minds immediately go to Ross and Rachel. Some viewers&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wonder if Ross was good enough for Rachel</a>, as the couple did have a lot of problems over several seasons.</p><p>Chandler and Monica, on the other hand, had a pretty straightforward romance that involved typical ups and downs and nervous moments.</p><p>One fan theory says that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monica cheated on Chandler</a>, which is something to think about since they always had a perfect relationship.</p><p>According to a fan who posted on Reddit, they explained, "Most would agree that Chandler definitely won’t cheat on Monica, although there were lots of signs that make me think Monica might have cheated on Chandler.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They said there are some reasons why Monica could potentially cheat on Chandler. One example is that in the sixth season episode "The One With&nbsp;The Proposal," Chandler was getting ready to ask Monica to marry him, and then Richard appeared. Monica seemed thrilled about this, which is admittedly a bit strange since she was in a serious relationship with Chandler at that moment.</p><p>The fan also noted that Monica was a big flirter, especially in a season five episode. The fan explained, "it's not technically cheating but she did challenge the moral ground."</p><p>While some viewers of course aren't sure that Monica would do this, there was a reply to the Reddit thread that suggested maybe she didn't treat Chandler as well as she could have. The fan wrote, "Finally someone else gets this! It's not only these things but the way she constantly challenges his worth. She keeps belittling him and acting like he could never get anyone else and that she is too good for him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox Thrills Fans With Her 5-Minute Makeup Secrets</a></span></p><h2 id=the-relationship>The Relationship</h2><p>Sometimes two characters seem totally meant&nbsp;to be together and it's obvious that writers will put them together.</p><p>Other times, it's a big surprise.</p><p>In the case of&nbsp;Friends, Saul&nbsp;Austerlitz wrote a book called&nbsp;Generation Friends: An Inside Look at the Show That Defined a Television Era&nbsp;and said it was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "on a whim" that Chandler and Monica dated.</a>.</p><p>The book explains,&nbsp;“When the second season was being planned, one of the writers tossed out an idea: ‘What if we get Chandler and Monica together? The thought was intended less as a permanent shift in the gravity of the series and more as a fun plotline, good for a few episodes before the status quo snapped back into place," according to&nbsp;People.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Feel Bad For Matthew Perry Post-'Friends' For This Reason" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Feel Bad For Matthew Perry Post-'Friends' For This Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-good-couple>A Good Couple?</h2><p>Monica and Chandler's love story seems pretty flawless. They're such good pals before they begin their romantic relationship, which helps them get to know one another, and they know&nbsp;each other's quirks.</p><p>Not every fan of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;thinks that they were the best couple, though.</p><p>One viewer shared on Reddit that they were "too lovey-dovey and mostly boring" and that they needed to have more things going wrong in order to be more interesting.</p><p>The fan wrote, "it completely ruined Chandler and Joey dynamic. Them being roommates was an important part of the show. After Chandler moves out, they barely do anything together. It also removed the Rachel and Monica dynamic but the impact was way less."</p><p>This is an interesting way to see the show. Some fans could say that it's good that the group changed after Monica and Chandler started dating as that's just what happens in real life. It's not always possible to continue to be so close when life gets in the way. Others could also argue that the gang got along so well that no one wanted anything to change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fan noted that Chandler used to always agree to whatever Monica wanted. If someone sees their romance this way, then the fan theory that Monica could have seen someone else behind Chandler's back does make sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="This ‘Friends’ Cast Member Was Surprisingly Against The Idea Of Reunion" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This ‘Friends’ Cast Member Was Surprisingly Against The Idea Of Reunion</a></span></p><p>Whether some fans of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;think that Monica could cheat on Chandler, or others are convinced that this would never happen, it's definitely a compelling fan theory to consider.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'Friends' Creators Reveal What It Took To Get Julia Roberts On The Show" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Friends' Creators Reveal What It Took To Get Julia Roberts On The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYrOztcSnm6xllpa7bsDHnqarsV2orrq%2FjKamp6GTlnqktMSaq56cXaS7bq%2FHmqWdpJWnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiktok-nationality-filter-effect-explained-how-to-do-the-nationality-challenge-everything-to-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tiktok Nationality Filter Effect Explained: How To Do The Nationality Challenge?
