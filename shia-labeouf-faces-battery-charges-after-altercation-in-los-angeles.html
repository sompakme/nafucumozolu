The 34-year-old actor was charged last week with one count of misdemeanor battery and one count of misdemeanor theft, the Los Angeles city attorney’s office has confirmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to prosecutors, LaBeouf allegedly used force and violence against a man named Tyler Murphy during an altercation on June 12. The actor then left with Murphy’s hat. The complaint requests a warrant for LaBeouf’s arrest.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Expensive Things Shia LaBeouf Spends His Money On</a></span></p><p>According to TMZ, LaBeouf and Murphy were involved in a verbal confrontation that got physical. Afterward, the actor allegedly grabbed Murphy’s cap and left. This isn’t the actor’s first brush with the law. In 2014, he was arrested outside New York City’s Studio 54 after he disrupted a performance of Cabaret while intoxicated. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to months of alcohol-abuse treatment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, LaBeouf was arrested again after fighting with a man at his He Will Not Divide Us protest in New York, though the charges were later dropped. Later that year, he was arrested for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct and obstruction in Savannah, Georgia. While at the police station, he launched into a tirade that included racially-charged comments.</p><p>After pleading no contest to a disorderly conduct charge in October 2017, LaBeouf was found guilty of obstruction but was found not guilty of <a href=#>public intoxication</a>. He was sentenced to probation for one year, including time served, and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine as well as seek therapy for his anger and substance use issues.</p><p>In 2018, he told Esquire that the incident in Georgia “was mortifying,”&nbsp;saying,&nbsp;“White privilege and desperation and disaster...It came from a place of self-centered delusion...It was me trying to absolve myself of guilt for getting arrested.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LaBeouf will star in the upcoming Pieces of a Woman opposite Vanessa Kirby, directed by Kornél Mundruczó, which premiered at the 77th Venice International Film Festival on September 4. He was originally due to star in the psychological thriller film Don't Worry Darling, directed by <a href=#>Olivia Wilde</a>, but had to back out due to scheduling conflicts.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>LATimes</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Body Cam Video Of Shia LaBeouf's Arrest Is Hard To Watch</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmirmJ6ubrjAm5yorZZis6KvxKxkm5mkqbKzxYycn5qql5rAbq3FrZyrZZGhwaa%2BwpqroqeeYravecuoqmaZnpyyrbHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-heinicke-children-meet-the-family-of-the-nfl-quarterback.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Heinicke Children: Meet The Family Of The NFL Quarterback</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rob-thomas-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rob Thomas Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
