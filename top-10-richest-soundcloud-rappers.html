Lil Ugly Mane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His material was not only a big hit because it was good but due to his cryptic social media posts, which looked as though he had an alter ego called Zeltron.

Now, he has 23+ million monthly listeners on Spotify!</p><h2 id=21-savage---8-million>4. 21 Savage - $8 million</h2><p>21 Savage (currently&nbsp;26) grew to fame when he was discovered by Atlanta rapper "Key!" who introduced him to some other music producers.

Post Malone - $12 million</h2><p>So, most of you probably don't know this, but Post Malone is a country fan. Ok, ok... maybe not, but he grew up&nbsp;in Texas, and his first musical experience was dominating guitar hero. Then, he upgraded to his first (real, not virtual) musical instrument, a Washburn Lyon. This wasn't enough for him though, and he continued to follow his dreams and moved to LA, where he grew popularity by performing with the group, BLKCVRD.</p><p>His fame as an individual artist though began on SoundCloud, where he released "White Iverson" in August 2015. This song landed him a recording contract with none other than Republic Records. This single did so well that it was named in reference to NBA star Allen Iverson. It continued to grow and landed on number 14 in the Billboards Hot 100.</p><p>His growth didn't stop, though. He continued with a few more collabs with Justin Bieber, Quavo, and Kehlani. In May 2018, Malone featured in the well-known "Jackie Chan" single that all you low-key rave fans are obsessed with.

He finished high school and began studying at Texas University until he dropped out after 2 years to pursue his musical career.

In 2011 he moved to LA to grow his networking and of course, it was a good idea because, in 2012, he signed to Epic Records and Kanye West's Good Music. He continued to grow with his mixtape, Owl Pharaoh, in 2013, which featured nonother than great artists such as Wale, 2 Chains, Meek Mill, and ASAP Ferg.</p><p>Scott's most popular album to date was Astroworld in 2018, which topped charts in the States, Canada, Belgium, and New Zealand.
