Tom Hopper has been brilliant in each season of the show, and he put in years of work to get to where he is now.</p><p>So, who was Tom Hopper before The Umbrella Academy? Let's look and see!</p><h2 id=tom-hopper-is-great-on-39-the-umbrella-academy-39>Tom Hopper Is Great On 'The Umbrella Academy'</h2><p>During its first two seasons on Netflix, The Umbrella Academy has been one of the coolest shows around. It is a brilliant take on the superhero genre, and one of the best aspects of the show is its terrific cast.</p><p>Tom Hopper was cast as Luther on the show, and he has been exceptional in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most notable physical characteristics that Luther has is his large body, and in order to pull this off, Tom Hopper was required to wear a large suit while filming.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview</a>, the actor opened up about what it was like to film while wearing the suit.</p><p>"We started shooting in the summer in Toronto which is a very, very hot time and in a suit it kind of doubles up so it was particularly hot! But you kind of get used to it; your body adjusts and you just get on with it. There’s no point in moaning about things like the suit really because it’s happening whether you like it or not! Also in a way, it really helped me find who Luther is. Luther is uncomfortable in that body, so whenever I put it on I feel like I know who Luther is. You know what his discomforts are and what the practicalities are of having a body that big," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things have really been taking off for the actor since landing on The Umbrella Academy, but the truth is that he was putting in a lot of work before scoring a lead role on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Umbrella Academy' Creator Gerard Way Pays Heartwarming Tribute To MCR Stage Manager Jacob Raggio</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-on-shows-like-39-black-sails-39>He Was On Shows Like 'Black Sails'</h2><p>Prior to landing on The Umbrella Academy, Tom Hopper had been working on television since 2007. Leading up to the role of Luther, he appeared on shows like Doctors, Kingdom, Doctor Who, Merlin, and Black Sails. He even had a brief stint on Game of Thrones!</p><p>Hopper's work on Black Sails as Billy Bones was genuinely fantastic, and many people familiarized themselves with his work thanks to his time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was Hopper great on the show, but he was also a huge fan. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, he cited one specific episode of Black Sails as his favorite episode of TV he has ever seen.</p><p>"This is arrogant, but episode five of season two of a show I’m in called Black Sails I thought was just a phenomenal piece of television. It was so well crafted, and it had an incredible twist at the end. I remember reading the script and being so excited immediately. It was a gamechanger for viewers, and hooked them right in," Hopper said.</p><p>Clearly, the actor knows how to do great work on television, but he has also made sure to do film work, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Umbrella Academy' Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-hopper-also-appeared-in-39-terminator-dark-fate-39>Tom Hopper Also Appeared In 'Terminator: Dark Fate'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FF9DC922-0A8B-41E3-AEDE-6DA70B373E52.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the big screen, Tom Hopper is not necessarily considered a prolific actor, but prior to landing the role of Luther on The Umbrella Academy, he was landing film roles to help sharpen his acting skills.</p><p>He made his film debut back in 2007 in the film Saxon, and from there, he would appear in movies like Tormented, Northman: A Viking Saga, Kill Ratio, and I Feel Pretty.</p><p>The same year that he started his time on The Umbrella Academy, Hopper would also appear in Terminator: Dark Fate.</p><p>For Hopper, the film must have felt like a dream come true. Turns out, he loved the franchise as a kid, and Arnold Schwarzenegger was his fitness influence.</p><p>The main one would be Terminator 2: Judgment Day. I watched it [when I was] quite younger than I should’ve been on VHS over and over again. I was obsessed with Arnie. That’s what started my love of motorbikes as well: Arnie riding around on his Harley," he told Men's Health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Luther From ‘Umbrella Academy, Tom Hopper, Dating In Real Life?</a></span></p><p>Season three of Tom Hopper's Umbrella Academy comes out soon, so be sure to catch up on the first two seasons beforehand!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Are Robert Sheehan's Biggest Roles (Besides 'Umbrella Academy')</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edOopGagn6W9pr6Mm5yfp6KaerW0xGasppqimrmtrYyampqclaLGcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angelina-s-drama-with-the-jersey-shore-cast-through-the-years.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angelinas Drama With the Jersey Shore Cast Through the Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-cox-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Cox Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
