The award-winning British actor is a household name in Hollywood popularly known for his role in the 2012 historical drama, <i>12 Years a Slave,&nbsp;</i>which earned him numerous accolades. Starting his acting career with stage plays during his junior school, the gifted actor nurtured his skills. Through hard work and patience, he has become one of the renowned actors of his generation.</p><p>Chiwetel Umeadi Ejiofor was born on the 10th of July 1977 in Forest Gate, London, to Nigerian parents, Obiajulu and Arinze Ejiofor, both of Igbo origin. His father was a doctor and a musician while his mother was a pharmacist. Chiwetel is the second of four siblings. One of his sisters, Zain Asher, is a popular CNN correspondent and the other (Kandibe Ejiofor) is a medical doctor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=an-overview-of-the-works-hes-known-for></span><strong>An Overview of The Works He’s Known For</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chiwetel Ejiofor developed a passion for acting as a teenager and began performing in stage plays at the age of 13 while at Dulwich College. He soon joined the National Youth Theatre before earning a scholarship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He has made stage appearances in plays like <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,&nbsp;<i>Blue/Orange</i>, and Othello.</p><p>Ejiofor’s sterling performances and talent on stage soon caught the eyes of Hollywood bigwigs. He made his television debut in the 1996 thriller&nbsp;Deadly Voyage. But when iconic film director Steven Spielberg, offered him a minor role in his 1997 feature film&nbsp;Amistad alongside&nbsp;Morgan Freeman, Chiwetel’s career changed for good. This breakthrough role eventually prompted Ejiofor to drop out of the Academy after his first year.</p><p>The British actor has worked on many more projects thereafter, playing versatile roles like Okwe in the 2002 movie Dirty Pretty Things. He came on&nbsp;as<i>&nbsp;</i>Mike Terry, a martial arts instructor in the 2008 movie Redbelt and as ANC leader Thabo Mbeki in the 2009 docu-drama, Endgame. Perhaps, his role in&nbsp;<span class=tvobject-cast-compact-year>the 2013 historical drama&nbsp;</span><span class=tvobject-cast-compact-year><i>12 Years a Slave, </i></span><span class=tvobject-cast-compact-year>is most worthy of a mention.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-sad-story-behind-the-scar-on-his-forehead></span><strong>The Sad Story Behind The Scar on His Forehead</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chiwetel lost his father in a car crash during a visit to Nigeria when he was only 11 and his father 39. The tragic accident which occurred while they were en route to a wedding left young Chiwetel physically scarred with a broken wrist. A long, thin scar on the side of his forehead bears testament to his survival of the incident that left him hospitalized for over two months.</p><p dir=auto>His mother, who was pregnant and in the United Kingdom at the time, was informed about the demise of her husband when she was flown out to see them at the hospital.</p><p dir=auto>She had a similar experience of chaos and sadness like Chiwetel during her formative years, at the age of 14 when the Biafran War displaced her family from their home in northern Nigeria. This experience Ejiofor shares with his mom knitted them together and made them have almost the same viewpoint of the world around them.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=impact-of-the-scar-on-his-career></span><strong>Impact of The Scar on His Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p dir=auto>Although it might have been feared at the beginning of his acting career that the scar would limit the actor from reaching the summit of his career, that didn’t happen. Fortunately for Chiwetel Ejiofor, the scar on his forehead hasn’t limited him to being cast only in a certain kind of role, as he has portrayed diverse lead and supporting roles in numerous films and TV series.</p><p dir=auto>Chiwetel who says acting has never really been about the money but a way of exploring some deeper question about himself, has been able to earn a good sum from his efforts in the industry, with a net worth estimated at $12 million.</p><p dir=auto>Disregarding the wealth he has accumulated, the numerous awards he has won also indicate that the scar on his face has not harmed his career. The versatile actor’s contributions to the industry have earned him several accolades including five Golden Globes nominations.</p><p>His outstanding performance in 12 Years a Slave fetched him bigger recognition globally, including BAFTA Award, BET Award, and the AACTA International Award. More so, for the success of the movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in 2014, as well as a nomination from the Golden Globes.
