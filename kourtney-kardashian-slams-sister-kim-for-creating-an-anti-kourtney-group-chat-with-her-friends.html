"They're your friends, the ones that you speak to on a daily basis,” the SKIMS founder said. “But you take it all out on me. And I'm trying the best that I can."</p><p>This prompted Kourtney to call her younger sister selfish. "It's about you. You are a narcissist," she clapped back.

Kourtney is currently expecting a baby with her new husband Travis Barker. She already has three kids from her relationship with Scott Disick.</p><p>"We all are concerned,” Kim pressed. “We all think that you're just really not happy."</p><p>To this, Kourtney replied, "So, you're telling me that I'm unhappy and that I'm miserable and that you have a side chat called 'Not Kourtney,' but you're telling me that you're happy for me.

"We have side chats about everybody. That's just what you do,” Kim said.</p><p>Kim and Kourtney have been feuding last year after Kim landed a partnership with Dolce & Gabana after they dressed Kourtney and Travis for their Italian wedding. Kourtney later accused <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim of turning her wedding into a networking</a> and business opportunity, and they’ve seemed to be on the out ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmKws7HArZysZZGjwap5yqisq6yemsZus9GorKllk52utXnFq6CeppSoeqex1J1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-lambert-wears-t-shirt-with-boyfriend-anderson-east-s-name.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Lambert Wears T-Shirt With Boyfriend Anderson Easts Name</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-bieber-the-kardashians-more-love-these-5-dubai-hotels.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber, The Kardashians, &amp;amp; More Love These 5 Dubai Hotels</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
