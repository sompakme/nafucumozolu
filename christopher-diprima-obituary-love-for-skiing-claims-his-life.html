The school “grieves the loss of” 10th grader DiPrima. It added that in light of what happened, counselors would be available for students who need them at all Excel campuses.</p><p>The post stated that Christopher was a kind and jolly person who brought joy to the people around him. He will be dearly missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Steven Gingras, DiPrima’s cousin, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WMUR</a> that DiPrima was a great big brother to his 12-year-old sister Gisel who always included her and treated her with incredible love and kindness.</p><p>“A kid who was nice, polite, smart, had his whole future ahead of him, but was very humble, very kind,” said Gingras while remembering the deceased.&nbsp;</p><p>DiPrima’s family was skiing on Duster Ski Trail at Pats Peak in Henniker, New Hampshire, at about 6:35 p.m. Saturday when the accident occurred.</p><p>Duster Ski Trail belongs to the category of intermediate-level skiing. DiPrima was brought to the base of the mountain by the ski patrol and later transferred to the Concord Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Gingras stated that this was not his deceased’s cousin’s first time skiing, and he had been going on skiing trips for a few years. Unfortunately, this time, he slipped, hit a bump, went flying, and landed a few meters down the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>The cause of the accident is under investigation. The authorities are taking this accident very seriously, as the loss of such a young life is devastating for the family of the victim.</p><p>The authorities, as well as the administration at Pats Peak, are working to ensure that accidents of such nature and impact do not occur in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>According to its website, the independent, family-owned Pats Peak originally opened in 1963. The ski area offers 11 lifts and 28 trails, with a base elevation of 690 feet and a summit elevation of 1,460 feet.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyfpbWmvoydoKmqmaKubrvBoquumaKufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-kingston-isn-t-bothered-by-people-commenting-about-his-physique.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eddie Kingston Isnt Bothered By People Commenting About His Physique</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./empire-actor-trai-byers-squashes-quitting-rumors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Empire' Actor Trai Byers Squashes Quitting Rumors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
