In a courtroom sketch, the actor was observed blowing a kiss to his wife just before being escorted to prison.</p><p>While Bijou may be working with her husband and his legal team to explore their options, an earlier report said the actress was shocked when he was given a three-decade sentence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Danny Masterson The Highest-Paid Cast Member On That '70s Show?</a></span></p><p>“She wasn’t prepared for the verdict,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said in June</a>, after Danny was found guilty of two counts of rape. “She never expected him to be found guilty.

Bijou, 43, and Danny, 47, have been married since 2011.</p><p>In 2020, Masterson faced charges of forcibly raping three women in separate incidents between 2001 and 2003. Following his arrest, he remained free on a $3.3 million bail. Then, in January 2021, he entered a not guilty plea to all three charges.</p><p>Last June, he was found guilty on two of the counts, while the third count led to a hung jury, with eight out of the jurors voting in favor of convicting the actor.</p><h2 id=many-famous-faces-requested-a-lenient-sentencing-for-danny>Many Famous Faces Requested A Lenient Sentencing For Danny</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/danny-masterson-mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite many famous faces writing to the court in support of Danny getting a lenient conviction, the That ‘70s Show star still received a decades-long sentence earlier this week.
