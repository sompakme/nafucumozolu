Tarantino was fresh off a brilliant and acclaimed debut, Reservoir Dogs, which enamored critics and audiences alike.</p><p>In 1993, Tarantino was sure that Michael Madsen, his Reservoir Dogs collaborator and actor, would appear in the prominent role of Vincent Vega in his second film.</p><p>And then, fate seemed to intervene — Madsen's standing commitment to another movie project opened the door for another actor to be cast as Vega: John Travolta.</p><p>After only seeing failure for a frustrating 13 years and counting, Travolta convinced Tarantino that he was, in fact, the perfect guy for the role of Vincent in Pulp Fiction.</p><p>An experienced actor with credits in the film industry for the past 16 years, he agreed to appear in Pulp Fiction for just $150,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pulp Fiction emerged <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as an instant cult classic</a>, and the characters played by Travolta, <a href=#>Uma Thurman</a>, and Samuel L. Jackson have remained iconic in the three decades since the movie's debut.</p><p>It took just one good role for John Travolta to get his career back on track. He raised his salary requirements, and sought $500,000 for his next project, White Man's Burden.</p><p>But his amazing work on Pulp Fiction was the spark he needed, and Travolta took home a salary of $4.2 million for his role in Get Shorty — and won a Golden Globe for "Best Actor."</p><p>Once a twice-struggling actor, John Travolta had once again reached a position where he could request millions of dollars to perform, and directors happily obliged.</p><h3 id=how-much-did-john-travolta-make-per-movie-after-pulp-fiction>How Much Did John Travolta Make Per Movie After Pulp Fiction?</h3><table
