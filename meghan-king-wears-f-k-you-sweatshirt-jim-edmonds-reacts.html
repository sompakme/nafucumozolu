Wearing a sweatshirt with the beer brand Budweiser on it, King noted that her clothing selection was “better than yesterday,” when her top read: “F—k This, F—k That, F—k You.”</p><p>Edmonds, 52, responded to the Bravo alum’s profanity-laden outfit in an exclusive statement to Us Weekly. “Jim obviously feels it is completely inappropriate to wear that sweatshirt around children, especially at their child’s school,” a rep for the <a href=#>former MLB player</a> said on Thursday, April 27. “You would think common sense would kick in at some point.”</p><p>King proceeded to clap back in a statement of her own, telling Us, “<a href=#>None of our kids can read</a>, but I doubt Jim knows that.” (The exes share daughter Aspen, 6, and twin sons Hayes and Hart, 4.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jim-Edmonds-Speaks-Out-About-Meghan-King.jpg><p>The pair — who tied the knot in 2014 — have been through several ups and downs since <a href=#>they split in October 2019</a>. Their struggles began before their breakup, with Edmonds <a href=#>denying rumors of infidelity</a> in June 2019. At the time, King claimed in a blog post that she <a href=#>no longer trusted her then-spouse</a>. “Physical or not, he still had an affair and he admits this to me,” she alleged.</p><p>King and the retired athlete <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in spring 2021, but their <a href=#>coparenting relationship</a> has come with challenges. “I don’t know what coparenting is,” the “Intimate Knowledge” podcast host — who was <a href=#>briefly married</a> to <a href=#><strong>Cuffe Owens</strong></a> in late 2021 — admitted to <a href=#>Us</a> in February 2022. “I struggle with communication [with Jim].”</p><p>Noting that she had no coparenting advice to share with others, King continued: “I don’t know what it is. Like, I don’t. I’d be the one to get advice. In order to coparent, <a href=#>you have to communicate</a> right? Yeah, so that would be a good start. … Jim hates me. It’s horrible.”</p><p>Edmonds — who married <a href=#><strong>Kortnie O’Connor</strong></a> in <a href=#>September 2022</a> — alluded to their coparenting struggles in a recent request to modify their custody agreement. He called his ex “unstable, unfit [and] unwilling to coparent and unable to provide an environment <a href=#>for the children</a> that is emotionally and physically safe” in a statement shared with Us in March after filing for split custody.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The California native claimed in court documents that his current arrangement with King is “impractical and unworkable.” According to their current setup, the two must submit their custody schedule 30 days in advance until they can agree on what days they will each have the kids each month. A <a href=#>Parent Coordinator</a> will step in to help if they can’t agree.</p><p>King later <a href=#>slammed Edmond’s accusations</a>. “I’ve been the primary parent and single mother of my children for 6 years,” she told Us on March 28. “He and his team’s wild claims are untrue, and anyone who is close with me or my children can attest to that — my children have always been and will <a href=#>remain my top priority</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWnmq6zv4yfZKRlqaTCbr%2FWnpitq5iev7V5yaKkZp2UoryvsNJmqZ6Zk6nAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mickey-hart-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mickey Hart Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jc-caylen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JC Caylen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
