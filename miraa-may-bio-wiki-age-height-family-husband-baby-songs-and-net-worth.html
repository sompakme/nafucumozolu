Being a pregnant woman working in the music industry and not quite breaking through, yet having to meet financial needs, I have pressured myself to keep on working. I headlined shows, travelled and wrote songs for people; I did Radio 1Xtra in Birmingham – my first-ever arena performance – in the midst of crazy pregnancy hormones. A few days before lockdown, I flew in from LA and did a show at XOYO, when my belly was so big I had to perform sitting down. It’s beautiful, because one day my son will be able to watch that – but it took a toll on me. So lockdown is the first time during my pregnancy that I’ve been able to chill at home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=miraa-may-salary></span><span>Miraa May Salary</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details about May’s salary are not yet disclosed.
