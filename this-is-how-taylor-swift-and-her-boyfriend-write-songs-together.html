The cute couple met sometime in 2016, but <a href=#>there is still fan speculation as to when exactly their initial meeting took place</a>. Regardless, the couple seems to have more than just romantic chemistry between the two of them. The pair collaborated on several of the songs on Swift's folklore and evermore albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="This Is The Real Way Taylor Swift And Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Met">This Is The Real Way Taylor Swift And Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Met</a></span></p><p>Like with most of her past relationships, the most Swift has revealed about her relationship with Alwyn has come through her songwriting. It is rare, though, for her to actually collaborate with her boyfriends on her songs. Back in 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift was credited for co-writing ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris' hit song "This Is What You Came For"</a> under the pseudonym "Nils Sjöberg." This time around, Swift's current boyfriend was credited as a co-writer and co-producer on many of the songs from her pandemic lockdown albums, leaving many wondering how these collaborations came about.</p><h2 id=which-songs-did-joe-alwyn-help-taylor-swift-write><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Which Songs Did Joe Alwyn Help Taylor Swift Write?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the pandemic lockdown in 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alwyn worked with Swift on a number of the hit songs from her folklore and evermore albums</a>. Under the pen name William Bowery, Alwyn is credited with co-writing "exile" and "betty" for Swift's folklore album. He also is credited with co-producing "exile," "betty," "my tears ricochet," "august," "this is me trying," and "illicit affairs." On Swift's evermore album, Alwyn helped the star write "champagne problems," "coney island," and "evermore."</p><h2 id=alwyn-and-swift-enjoy-writing-sad-songs-together><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Alwyn And Swift Enjoy Writing Sad Songs Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being in a happy relationship, the couple enjoys writing sad songs together. Swift explained in an Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe that they both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"just really love sad songs."</a> Swift also provided insight into how a significant part of her relationship with Alwyn has been their shared taste in music, particularly when it comes to sad songs.</p><h2 id=how-did-joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift-write-together><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Did Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Write Together?</span></h2><p>Though the pandemic lockdowns brought plenty of despair to many, they gave Alwyn and Swift the opportunity to collaborate on not one but two albums. Alwyn described their collaboration as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"most accidental thing to happen in lockdown."</a> Swift happened to hear Alwyn playing what is now the melody of "exile" on the piano and singing what would become the song's opening verse. Swift told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pair wrote "evermore" using a similar process</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Joe Alwyn Addresses Those Taylor Swift Engagement Rumors">Joe Alwyn Addresses Those Taylor Swift Engagement Rumors</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-taylor-swift-have-to-say-about-their-collaborations><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Does Taylor Swift Have To Say About Their Collaborations?</span></h2><p>In Swift's Disney+ documentary Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift revealed that the verse that Alwyn wrote for "exile" was eventually sung by Bon Iver's Justin Vernon in a duet with Swift. Swift opened up about how both she and Alwyn are huge fans of Bon Iver, leaving Swift too nervous to even ask producer Aaron Dessner to send the track to Vernon. However, when Dessner eventually sent Vernon the demo, Vernon not only agreed to sing Alwyn's verse, but, much to Swift's excitement, he ended up writing the bridge for the song as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-joe-alwyn-choose-his-pen-name-william-bowery><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Did Joe Alwyn Choose His Pen Name William Bowery?</span></h2><p>Alwyn's pen name was William Bowery, and he recently revealed how he chose it. Alwyn told Kelly Clarkson that his pen name is the combination of his composer great-grandfather's first name William and the name of an area of New York that Alwyn frequented when he moved there. Alwyn explained that they used a pen name to allow fans to listen to the songs without initially realizing that he was behind them.</p><h2 id=swift-and-alwyn-won-a-grammy-for-their-songwriting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Swift And Alwyn Won A Grammy For Their Songwriting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the 2021 Grammy Awards, <a href=#>Swift won Album of the Year for folklore</a>, making Alwyn a Grammy winner as well. This honor made Swift the first female artist to win Album of the Year three times. Swift won her first Album of the Year award for Fearless and her second for 1989.</p><h2 id=who-writes-most-of-taylor-swift-39-s-songs><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Who Writes Most Of Taylor Swift's Songs?</span></h2><p>It is not often that Swift collaborates with her boyfriends, but some of her biggest hits are the products of collaborations with other songwriters and producers. Swift frequently collaborates with Bleachers' Jack Antonoff, The National's Aaron Dessner, and Ed Sheeran. <a href=#>Swift has written over fifty songs on her own</a>. For the songs on her albums that she did not write independently, she is credited as a co-writer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Taylor Swift Really Thinks Of Joe Alwyn's Romance Scenes">What Taylor Swift Really Thinks Of Joe Alwyn's Romance Scenes</a></span></p><h2 id=what-songs-has-swift-written-about-alwyn><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Songs Has Swift Written About Alwyn?</span></h2><p>Alwyn is not only Swift's co-collaborator, but he also serves as her muse. Many of Swift's songs on her reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) albums seem to be about her relationship with Alwyn. Swift's songs <a href=#>"Gorgeous," "London Boy," "Paper Rings," and "Lover,"</a> draw inspiration from Swift's relationship with Alwyn, including his blue eyes, his London origins, and even getting to know his younger brother, Patrick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-joe-alwyn-write-more-songs-with-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will Joe Alwyn Write More Songs With Taylor Swift?</span></h2><p>As of right now, no. In an interview with Elle magazine, Alwyn stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is not currently planning on writing more music in the future</a>. Alwyn is currently busy with acting. He recently starred in Hulu's miniseries adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel Conversations with Friends, and his next film, The Stars at Noon, is set to release on May 25th. Still, given that Swift and Alwyn's collaborations on folklore and evermore were not planned either, never say never?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Taylor Swift Is Officially A Doctor!
