The duo were friends for years before things turned romantic.</p><p>“She had Travis right in front of her the whole time,” the source says. “All it took was that leap of faith and now she thanks God she made it.”</p><p>Kardashian “was crying tears of joy” when Barker got down on one knee, the insider notes, adding, “Kourtney <a href=#>was caught off guard</a> when Travis proposed but she said yes instantly … The way she tells it, he totally surprised her with this magical proposal that was like a scene from a Disney movie.”</p><p>The couple’s relationship has only “gotten more and more perfect” since sparks first flew — and the Grammy nominee <a href=#>even has the approval</a> of his fiancée’s famous family.</p><p>“They see how he treats Kourtney like a princess,” the insider tells Us. “Plus, she’s just crazy about him and that’s what matters. … This is already such an exciting time for the family and the wedding is going to be huge.”</p><p>Barker was <a href=#>previously married</a> to <a href=#><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a> from 2004 to 2008 and the exes share son Landon, 18, and daughter Alabama, 15. The former <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star, for her part, has three children — Mason, 11, Penelope, 9, and Reign, 6 — with ex <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>. The pair <a href=#>dated on and off for nine years</a> before splitting for good in 2015.</p><p>Amid her ups and downs with Disick, 37, the California native had frequently expressed her doubts about marriage. In March 2020, however, Kardashian appeared to be coming around to the idea of walking down the aisle.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I feel like I’m really content, but I think if it was the right situation, I think it’s something that I would want. But I don’t feel like it’s missing,” she said on E!’s In the Room, noting at the time that she would “never share a relationship publicly” the way she did with Disick. “Scott and I, for 10 years being together, <a href=#>our whole relationship was on the show</a> and I felt like the toll that it took on us — you know, there were other things too, obviously — I felt like it was hard on our relationship.”</p><p>While the Blink-182 drummer wasn’t featured heavily on KUWTK, a source told Us earlier this week that his proposal was<a href=#> filmed for the family’s upcoming Hulu series</a>.</p><p>For more on the newly engaged couple’s romance, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZJudnJ6yt7HSZp2imZ6Ysm7A0Zqtoqtdl66zt8SrZKKrXZ2ys3nSqKylZZ2WwaZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-mescall-an-irish-teen-died-after-attempting-a-deadly-viral-tiktok-challenge.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Mescall, an Irish Teen, Died After Attempting a Deadly Viral TikTok Challenge</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-hudson-kind-of-liked-false-brad-pitt-dating-rumors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Hudson Kind of Liked False Brad Pitt Dating Rumors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
