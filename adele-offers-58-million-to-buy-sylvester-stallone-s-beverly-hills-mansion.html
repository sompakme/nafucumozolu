According to insiders, the offer Adele made for the purchase of the mansion is already a steal as it seems a little wild on surface but considering that the last offer the mansion received was $80 million and Stallone wanted a hefty amount of $110 million, the offer still somewhat makes sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Adele Reaches Divorce Settlement With Ex Nearly 2 Years After Separation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>sprawling estate of Sylvester Stallone</a> sits on 3.5 acres of land which features eight bedrooms and twelve bathrooms.
