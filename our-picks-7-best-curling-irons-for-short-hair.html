Short hair requires special attention when it comes to styling your locks, and this is especially true if you’re looking to create curls. You can’t use the same types of curling tools that work for long or medium-length hair. When shopping for a curling iron or round hot brush that will get you the exact type of style you’re looking for, you have to be meticulous about doing research.</p><p>Not sure where to begin looking for your perfect short hair-friendly curling iron? Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered! Whether you want a quick and easy styler that you can use on the daily or one that’s specifically designed for choppy, beachy waves, we have the ultimate collection of tools that can work wonders for short hair lengths. Happy styling!</p><p><strong>Best 3-in-1 Curling Iron</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/T3-Whirl-Trio-Interchangeable-Styling-Wand-Set.png><p>Some tools are so fantastic that they benefit people with all types of haircuts. This three-in-one curler is a bestseller on Dermstore, and judging by the reviews, we totally understand why! There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">different sizes</a> so you can snag every type of curl that you prefer. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cone-shaped wands</a> help you control how tight or loose your curls come out. We especially appreciate this size for shorter styles, because the curl will end up longer and looser. Sometimes traditional barrel-style can create a lot of volume, which doesn’t always look great with particularly short hair. The tapered curl makes that issue a thing of the past!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">T3 Whirl Trio Interchangeable Styling Wand Set</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$325</a>, available at Dermstore!</strong></p><p><strong>Best For Everyday Use</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FHI-Heat-Stylus-Thermal-Styling-Brush-2.jpg><p>As far as your everyday curling needs are concerned, this is definitely a go-to tool. If your hair is short, you don’t necessarily need a massive curling brush to leave your hair looking flawless! It has double-sided barrel with hairbrush prongs to help you brush out your mane, and keep it in check while curling. For pixie cuts and other short styles, this is definitely one of the easiest tools to maneuver. When you need to get ready in a pinch, you don’t want to use a curling wand that requires extra time to get the style right. This is also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a great curling iron</a> to use if you have bangs! You can curl them and then brush them out with this tool to get your fringe exactly how you want it.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">FHI Heat Stylus Thermal Styling Brush</span></a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$69</a>, available at Amazon!

Shoppers say that there is a “learning curve” when it comes using this wand, but with time and practice, you can get incredible results! Your curls will have more of a pop to them when you use this type of tool.

Over the past couple of years or so, beauty gurus on YouTube have been teaching the world how to get curls using a flat iron. The type of wave that can be created with straighteners has become so popular because they come out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looking beachy and effortless</a>. And if you don’t want to buy multiple tools for different purposes, using a flat iron as a curling tool takes care of that!
