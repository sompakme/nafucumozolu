Former Disney Channel stars such as Shia LeBeouf have continued to find themselves roles despite facing a lot of legal issues. Some have maintained their relevancy even if they are not at the height of their fame, such as Hilary Duff when she played Lizzie McGuire and gained roles in mainstream movies during the early 2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Shake it Up came out in 2010, the show became a hit and turned up-and-coming actresses <a href=#>Bella Thorne</a> and <a href=#>Zendaya</a> into superstars. Lasting for three years with three seasons, while also breaking the 65-episode rule by having ten more episodes, the show introduced Disney Channel viewers to talented women who would go on to be successful in their careers today. They remain friends despite their hectic schedules, and it was believed that they never got along despite showcasing great chemistry. How did Disney Channel start the feud between the two, and why?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bella Thorne Reveals She And Zendaya Were “Pitted Against” Each Other While On Disney</a></span></p><h2 id=shake-it-up-kickstarted-their-careers>Shake It Up Kickstarted Their Careers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sitcom not only kick-started Thorne and Zendaya's acting careers, but also their music endeavors. As it's somewhat of a trend for specific Disney Channel stars to become singers, the two stars were also brought on board to being the acting/singing combo for Shake it Up. After the show ended, Thorne announced that she was working on a debut album featuring 11 songs. Unfortunately, its release got canceled and was instead released an EP titled Jersey in 2014. <a href=#>Zendaya's music career was a bit luckier in debuting</a>, with her eponymous debut studio album coming out in 2013 to decent success and critical acclaim. Combined with the song "Rewrite the Stars" featuring Zac Efron from the movie The Greatest Showman, Zendaya garnered her commercial success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shake it Up is not without scandal during its runtime, as it faced controversy when an episode showcased a female character telling the two leads, "I could just eat you guys up...you know, if I ate." This eating disorder joke deservingly received a negative reception, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">garnering the attention of Demi Lovato, who sought therapy for her eating disorder after leaving Disney Channel.</a> They commented that a network to normalize something so dangerous is absolutely careless. What also makes Shake it Up controversial is the treatment of the two starlets and how their friendship was played with by Disney themselves.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Bella Thorne Still Earning Millions On OnlyFans?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-the-feud-between-zendaya-and-bella-thorne-started>How The Feud Between Zendaya And Bella Thorne Started</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years, many fans believed that Zendaya and Thorne actually could not stand each other. There is a small truth to that, as they were essentially forced to compete with one another, and it didn't help that their personalities at the time clashed. Their relationship in general has thankfully managed to flourish as they continued working together.</p><p>In an interview with Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thorne opened up on her time with Zendaya on the show.</a> Describing how the first season put them on a rocky start, Thorne said, “We had to deal with that so much on Shake It Up. It’s like we said [in] a couple interviews when we were younger, how we explained how in the first season we weren’t friends and it took us those other two seasons of becoming so close. [It was hard] not having someone pitted against you [before] and then all of a sudden, now everyone is pitting you against each other. That fed into our heads. It made us not [be] friends in that first season.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With how Hollywood treats women into thinking they're inferior to another, it is one of the toxic mindsets that Disney Channel should never resort to again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Disney Almost Ruined Zendaya's Career Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><h2 id=what-are-zendaya-and-bella-thorne-up-to-today>What Are Zendaya And Bella Thorne Up To Today?</h2><p>Past through their initial hardships with each other and becoming great friends, the two stars have found success after their time on Disney Channel. Zendaya is becoming one of the most sought-out actresses in the industry due to her roles in Spider-Man: Homecoming plus its sequels, and starring in HBO Max's Euphoria, earning her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She also became the youngest recipient of that nomination, which further cements her progress as an actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being in a relationship with her costar Tom Holland also contributed in her stardom and following on social media. There was a ton of fan support for the two rumored in being together, and when that was confirmed, she and Holland instantly became one of Hollywood's most recent hottest couple. Zendaya has grown into popularity and is definitely continuing her ride in success as her upcoming projects including A White Lie, Finest Kind, Dune: Part Two, and Challengers.</p><p>Thorne, on the other hand, has continued her acting career, but took many people by surprise when she joined OnlyFans. She became the first person to earn a million dollars in the first 24 hours. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Midnight Sun star also dealt with controversy</a> as she promised her subscribers nudes for $200, but the photos were instead of her in lingerie. ScreenRant also added that she was using the adult content website in order to do research for a film she planned to make with Sean Baker. He denied the claims later on. She also added that the money made from OnlyFans would support her production company and provide donations for charity."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For music, Thorne started her record label Filthy Fangs in 2018, and has her debut album finally coming out in 2022 titled What Do You See Now?. For films, she starred in Chick Fight, Habit, and her upcoming movie Leave Not One Alive, which is coming out on March 18th.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Zendaya Isn't Just An Emmy Winner: All Her Biggest Awards And Nominations</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmspWjsaLFwGaYp5xdl7KtuMBmq6GnoqOycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lou-dobbs-net-worth-how-much-is-dobbs-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lou Dobbs Net Worth How Much is Dobbs Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fbi-international-s-heida-reed-thanks-fans-after-season-3-exit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>FBI: Internationals Heida Reed Thanks Fans After Season 3 Exit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
