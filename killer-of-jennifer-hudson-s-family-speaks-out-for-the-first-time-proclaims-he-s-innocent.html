Her sister’s estranged husband, <a href=# id=auto-tag_william-balfour_1 data-tag=william-balfour>William Balfour</a>, was <a href=# rel=nofollow>convicted of three counts of first-degree murder</a> for the act, and sentenced to life behind bars in 2012. In his first interview since his conviction, Balfour is claiming that he is innocent.</p><p>“I didn’t have nothing to do with her family being killed. Period,” Balfour told ABC 7’s I-Team. “I didn’t have nothing to do with the case and don’t know who had anything to do with the case.”</p><p>Evidence in the case pointed to Balfour, as gun residue was found on his clothing and the steering wheel of his vehicle. He was also found with the keys to the the stolen SUV where the 7-year-old was found shot to death. Witnesses came forward to identify Balfour as well, noting that he was carrying a black and silver pistol. According to police records, Balfour also had a long rap sheet that included gang activity and a <a href=# rel=nofollow>1992 attempted murder conviction</a>. According to him, however, he now serves a life sentence because of a conspiracy by Chicago police, who he says planted the evidence against him in the triple murder.</p><p>“It’s up to them to make sense out of it,” he said. “Because if you make a statement, and the statement don’t add up to the way the murders happened, then it’s a problem. That’s reasonable doubt.”</p><p>Balfour was also questioned about why he declined to take the stand in his trial, and whether or not he had threatened to kill Hudson’s family before the day of his violent rage. He said he was told by his lawyers not to testify, and that he had never made any threats of the sort. Asked what he would say to Hudson if they were face-to-face, Balfour replied that he would state his innocence.</p><p>“I didn’t have nothing to do with her family being killed. Period.” he said. He was also asked if he still thinks of Hudson’s 7-year-old nephew. “Of course. I don’t know man. Do I miss him? Yeah. Do I love him? Yeah. It could’ve been the wrong place at the wrong time. A person who comes in there to kill somebody don’t care who they kill.”</p><p>Chicago police are standing behind the “overwhelming” evidence against William Balfour.
