We wait for them to break out. If nothing else, celebrity beefs give us a glimpse at the human behind the star. These days, celebs are just so programmed and polished, they almost never show their true colors. But, once their cages are rattled, they open up. It's not always pretty, but neither are we when we get mad. Sadly, people make forever judgements about celebs because of these feuds. We're all guilty of it. These stars say and do&nbsp;questionable&nbsp;things when they're angry. They lash out, act a fool. We should be more forgiving. So, we'll try to avoid making major character judgments here. Instead, we will simply lay out the alleged feuds and give the most up-to-date news on where it all stands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you're dealing with the average Hollywood feud, it's easy to pick sides. But these aren’t the average feuds. The feuds here are the ones that involve one-time friends from the Disney machine. Each of the people on this list are old pals. Most worked together at some point or simply knew each other through Disney functions. Many grew up together and stayed close over the years. But all, for various reasons, fell out. Now, the things about celebrity feuds is that they are often like rollercoasters. Some celebs feud and then reconnect, feud and then reconnect. Some of the actors involved even claim their feuds are done when they're clearly not. We're smarter than that. We can see that though they claim to be "friends," things will never be the same. Here are 20 (once-besties) Disney stars who can’t be in the same room anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=debby-ryan-and-skai-jackson><strong>Debby Ryan and Skai Jackson</strong></h2><p>Debby Ryan and Skai Jackson starred together on Jessie for years and, in the early days, they were inseparable. Despite their sizable age difference, the two seemed to really love each other behind the scenes. But, according to Twist Magazine, these two aren't as friendly as the used to be. Fans first took notice of a divide when Jackson unfollowed Ryan on social media. After that, Jackson accused Ryan of pushing her around and bullying her on set. Ryan denied the accusations but sent out a thinly veiled critique of what most assumed was pointed at Jackson.</p><p>There were then several awkward interviews about the matter, pictures posted with blurred out faces and plenty of shade thrown on social media between the two. Despite the fact that these two apparently moved on with their lives, it's safe to say that they would rather not be around each other in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-jonas-and-aly-michalka><strong>Joe Jonas and Aly Michalka</strong></h2><p>Aside from being one of the most beautiful women on the planet, Aly Michalka is also a former Disney gal. Now, neither party has offered up too many of the details about their breakup, but there's enough evidence to put together a story of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas</a> and Aly Michalka. Here's what we know.</p><p>Michalka herself admitted that&nbsp;these two Disney stars were once each other's first loves. They dated, and they kissed, and it was sweet. According to Clevver, they broke up and haven't been great friends since. This might be because of how they broke up. It seems that Jonas forgot about or neglected to show up to Michalka's birthday one year, so she ended things with him. According to Jonas, he got a piece of melted ice cream cake mailed to him as a gesture. At least it wasn't a&nbsp;deceased fish.</p><h2 id=rowan-blanchard-and-uriah-shelton><strong>Rowan Blanchard and Uriah Shelton</strong></h2><p>After Girl Meets World went off the air, one of the actors, Uriah Shelton, was reflecting on his time on the show. The interviewer was wondering about the cast, who had gotten along so swimmingly in the beginning, and if they had any plans to reconnect or hang out. After all, they all seemed so happy together on the set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shelton's response made it seem that, while some of the cast will surely remain chums, but he and Rowan Blanchard were no longer in the friend-zone. "As for Rowan, Rowan doesn’t necessarily like me," he said in an interview with Seventeen. "We’ve had a lot of [differences]. She doesn’t really like me. I don’t care. I mean, I don’t have anything against her. She’s a very, you know, passionate girl. She definitely wholeheartedly believes what she does."</p><h2 id=raven-symon-and-orlando-brown><strong>Raven-Symoné and Orlando Brown</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven-Symoné</a>&nbsp;and Orlando Brown starred together on That's So Raven for years. They were always quite close and even dated for a time, according to Brown's interview on Vlad TV. Yet, while Raven was also quiet about the situation, Brown decided to discuss intimate details about their relationship to whoever and whenever he could.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, it's likely that this was just done for attention, just to keep his name in the media, but it put some distance between the two. Then there were rumors that Brown might even be included in the show's return, but he all but shut that door when he was charged with a crime in 2018 after a fight with his girlfriend. We feel secure in stating that, if Raven was ever considering reconnecting with Brown, she likely won't be too quick to follow through now.</p><h2 id=jeanette-mccurdy-and-ariana-grande><strong>Jeanette McCurdy and Ariana Grande</strong></h2><p>Way back when, on Sam and Cat, Jeanette McCurdy and <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> were in friend love. They were BFFs on the show and, in real life, seemed to be as close as can be. But, while things started out great between the two leads, it all changed near the end of the season. When the show was cancelled, people started suggesting that there was a feud. Despite the actresses claiming there wasn't a true beef, the proof may be in the pudding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First of all, there was a pay discrepancy. This might have been the first issue. Then McCurdy unfollowed Grande and failed to accompany her to the Kids Choice Awards. This, McCurdy said on Twitter, was related to a "compromising" position she was put in. When Grande posted a note on Twitter about the show's cancellation, she didn't even mention McCurdy. Listen, we understand that things are blown out of proportion all the time, but this seems to be as clear as day. If there was a feud, McCurdy listening to Grande's song in her car years later doesn’t mean that it's been settled.</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-and-ryan-gosling><strong>Justin Timberlake and Ryan Gosling</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> are two of the world's biggest superstars. They both left the Mickey Mouse Club and became international sensations, Gosling for his acting and Timberlake for his music (and acting). Over the years, it became known that Gosling lived with the Timberlake family for a time when they were kids. These two apparently became very close friends during that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, despite everyone's wishes that these two are still BFFs, it's just not true. They aren't best friends. They may not even be friends. Yes, even though they both suggest that they are, there is some distance there. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Timberlake&nbsp;admitted that the two former friends don't talk much anymore and that they aren't the closest of friends. Blaming it on growing up and being busy or whatever you want, but, when you dig into their comments on the matter, it's clear that they haven’t been close for a long time, and their memories of their friendship differ greatly.</p><h2 id=winona-ryder-and-gwyneth-paltrow><strong>Winona Ryder and Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></h2><p>Alright, so neither <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a> or <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> are the standard Disney actresses, but they've both worked for Disney in the past, so they count. Besides, they had a great alleged feud. Long ago, they were the best of friends. They were like two peas in a pod. Then, suddenly, they weren't friends anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is about the time that a rumor started about Paltrow "stealing" the lead in Shakespeare in Love from Ryder, and a feud was born. After a while, it fizzled and went away, but then Paltrow posted a letter online on Goop detailing a "frenemy" who tried to take her down and threw gasoline on the fire. Now, it's possible that Paltrow was talking about someone else, but the evidence and the timing seems to suggest that she still holds a grudge (for whatever reason) against Ryder.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-and-emily-osment><strong>Miley Cyrus and Emily Osment</strong></h2><p>It's certainly not true that <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=#>Emily Osment</a> "can't" be in the same together. People just wonder if they want to be in the same room together. In the early days, everyone believed that Cyrus and Osment were the same best friends in real life as they were on-screen. That turned out not to be the case. In interviews with&nbsp;Seventeen&nbsp;and in Miley's autobiography,&nbsp;Miles to Go, both Cyrus and Osment cited struggles in their relationship during the later years of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then the show ended and we rarely, if ever, saw them together. Sure, they would post nice things to each other on social media&nbsp;every once in a while to break down the gossip, but that was it. Lately, Instagram proved the rest of the Hannah Montana cast has reunited a couple of times to hang out, but Cyrus is always absent. Despite her having an excuse, what with her being a giant star, but it still begs the question: have Cyrus and Osment grown apart?</p><h2 id=hutch-dano-and-adam-hicks><strong>Hutch Dano and Adam Hicks</strong></h2><p>Hutch Dano and Adam Hicks rose to fame together on the Disney show, Zeke and Luther. Behind the scenes, these two were the best of buds. Their interviews were great because of the connection they had. They were often found hanging out together during the show's run and even afterward for time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that was years ago now, and things have most definitely changed. For one, Hutch Dano is not about to hang out with a suspected armed robber. Oh, you didn't hear? According to Variety, Hicks and his girlfriend held up and robbed up to three people. The two suspects were arrested shortly afterward and brought into custody. Though we don’t exactly know Dano's thoughts on his one-time friend and co-star, it's a no-brainer that if he was going to try and rekindle their friendship, he's probably going to wait a bit now.</p><h2 id=shia-labeouf-and-the-even-stevens-cast><strong>Shia LaBeouf and the Even Stevens Cast</strong></h2><p>We don't want this to turn into a <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a> slagging party. The guy takes enough heat for his bold personality as it is, so we're gong to leave him alone. But, if you go through all the work that LaBeouf did with Disney, there are few old friends of his that he is still connected with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, according to Bustle,&nbsp;most of his old co-stars say that they haven't spoken to him in years. LaBeouf himself has said that he doesn't really stay in touch with anyone, and that includes sis from Even Stevens or any of the Holes crew. But LaBeouf is doing his own thing. He's very creative and very loud in the spotlight, so it would take a special type of person to stay connected to that. Not that there's anything wrong with LaBeouf. It's just the way things are.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-and-america-ferrera><strong>Lindsay Lohan and America Ferrera</strong></h2><p>Though <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> and <a href=#>America Ferrera</a> were short-lived co-stars on Ugly Betty, the two were said to be fast-friends on set. At first, Ferrera said that it was a riot having Lohan around and that they shared a lot of laughs. But their fun was cut short when Lohan's six-episode arc got sliced down to four. Why? Well, that is the big question.</p><p>The one trigger that The Huffington Post&nbsp;points to is a stunt where Ferrara needed to pull Lohan's pants down, getting her character back for doing the same prank to Betty earlier in their relationship. But, it seems, Lohan didn't get the memo. When Ferrera pulled down her "friends" pants, Lohan, allegedly, wasn't wearing anything else. Allegedly, this set her running off set crying. Next came her dismissal. Despite the story sounding weird and a little far-fetched, it's the only somewhat plausible explanation fans were given.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-and-victoria-justice><strong>Ariana Grande and Victoria Justice</strong></h2><p>The alleged feud between Ariana Grande and <a href=#>Victoria Justice</a> from their days on Victorious has been circling for years now. When either of the women involved are asked directly about it, they deny everything. They say that they were friends and still are friends. But fans continue to ask, is this true?</p><p>There seemed to be tension between the two from early on, but the supposed feud truly started when Grande was asked why the show was cancelled. Her response to that question, rocked Disney fans. "If we had done a cast tour," she wrote online at Ask.Fm. "Nickelodeon would have ordered another season of Victorious while Sam & Cat filmed simultaneously but she [Justice] chose otherwise." Though Grande would later apologize to Justice, it's clear that a long-standing grudge existed between the two. Sure, they may not hate each other, but they don't seem like great friends either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=raven-symon-and-the-cheetah-girls><strong>Raven-Symoné and The Cheetah Girls</strong></h2><p>Despite the somewhat recent reunion between Raven-Symoné and Belinda Peregrin from the Cheetah Girls, things aren't all gravy between Raven and the other members of the group. When the Cheetah Girls first started, Raven-Symoné was sort of crammed in with the other three members, hoping to leverage Raven's TV popularity to help the group. It worked.</p><p>Yet, while the three girls all did tours and album releases, Raven only appeared in the films alongside them. This, it seems, created tension among them. Despite their alleged fights and arguments behind the scenes, however, they claimed to remain friends through it all. But then Raven backed out of the third Cheetah Girls film and the relationship fell apart. During her reunion with Peregrin on Twitter, Raven mentioned that, of all the girls, Peregrin is the only one she is still connected with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wizards-of-waverly-place-cast><strong>Wizards of Waverly Place Cast</strong></h2><p>Last year, The Wizards of Waverly Place cast all reunited at David Henrie's wedding and they seemed like a big happy family, but don’t let their smiling faces fool you. There's been drama there. So much drama that people wonder if there's not more to the story than meets the eye. It all started back when Jake Austin seemingly criticized <a href=#>Selena Gomez's</a> choice to appear in the explicit Spring Breakers film by tweeting, "When an artist’s definition of ‘growing with their fans’ is creating content they aren’t even allowed to see…"</p><p>Later, Henrie commented about Gomez's public image in an interview with the Christian Post, even comparing it, in a weird way, to his holier-than-thou persona. Sure, they all still connect at major functions, but they may not be the great friends they appear to be. If they didn’t reconnect, it would become an even bigger story and threaten to hurt everyone's careers. Playing nice is just smart business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-and-the-sprouse-twins><strong>Selena Gomez and the Sprouse Twins</strong></h2><p>These three were all part of the same group growing up. They were all important members of the Disney team and may have been the three best friends that anyone could have. Then they got older and Gomez became more distant, at least, that's how the Sprouse twins remember it. At some point, they stopped talking altogether.</p><p>These days, Gomez won't even follow the twins on social media. It's possible she gave the boys the time of day after they publicly called her out on Twitter for ignoring them, but don't go thinking these three are hanging out like it's old times. Gomez has moved on to bigger and better things apparently. Her friends are some of the biggest names on the planet. It's got to be tough for her to make time for others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mitchel-musso-and-hannah-montana-cast><strong>Mitchel Musso and Hannah Montana Cast</strong></h2><p>Alright, so the Hannah Montana cast, minus Miley Cyrus, have hung out a few times recently. That seems to prove that they are all still friends, but you have to wonder if Mitchel Musso isn't on the outside looking in on his old friend group. It wasn't all that long ago that Musso was arrested for a DUI and released from two of his shows. According to People, Musso failed&nbsp;to slow down for police at a traffic stop and was taken in for suspicion of being under the influence. After testing him, the police determined they were right.</p><p>Now, Musso did take responsibility for his actions and apologized for them, but this may have created a bit of a divide between him and his former castmates. If one thing is for certain, Musso won't be the one driving during their friendly outings any time soon.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-and-christina-aguilera><strong>Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera</strong></h2><p>On International Women's Day, <a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a> made a post on Instagram celebrating her industry women. She included <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, which caught people's attention. After all, weren't Britney and Christina supposed to be feuding? This is the rumor at least. Well, apparently not, if the post is any indication. But one social media post does not erase the history between these two. While they may get along on the internet from afar, it's doubtful they get together to swap recipes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Remember back when Christina ridiculed Britney after she married Kevin Federline? Let us jog your memory. Aguilera apparently said to&nbsp;US Weekly, “I can’t believe that girl bought her own engagement ring! I’ve seen it, up close. It looks like she got it on QVC.” She then added, “I know Britney. She’s not trailer trash, but she sure acts that way.” They may not be actively feuding anymore, but Britney likely won't forget what Aguilera said anytime soon.</p><h2 id=joshua-jackson-and-the-mighty-ducks-cast><strong>Joshua Jackson and the Mighty Ducks Cast</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Joshua Jackson</a> first came to fame by playing Charlie Conway on The Mighty Ducks. While many of the actors from that franchise would go on to become stars in their own right, Jackson is the big kid on the block. He's the star of The Mighty Ducks. He's the one who did the most with his career, and he's the one with the biggest name to this day. So why is Jackson not in this reunion picture?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps his big name is the reason why he doesn't show up to Mighty Ducks events&nbsp;or why he seems do distant from the group. Yes, he did say that he would support a new film if they were to make it but there seemed to be hesitancy in his comments to Time. He even said that he would return for a new film, but fans are still doubtful. Jackson can't even make time for his old friends on the 20th anniversary. How you going to have a Mighty Ducks reunion and not have Charlie Conway there?</p><h2 id=joe-jonas-and-cole-sprouse><strong>Joe Jonas and Cole Sprouse</strong></h2><p>So maybe Joe Jonas and Cole Sprouse weren't your prototypical "besties" from back in the day, but they grew up together on the Disney channel, and they were friendly at the various functions. But things got a bit heated after Jonas complained about his creativity being stifled when he was with Disney in a post in&nbsp;New York Magazine. Cole Sprouse saw this and took issue. He decided to comment on it, suggesting that it was all a load of crap on Tumblr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sprouse said that in his experience with Disney, he never had a problem with creativity. If he ever did, he would speak his mind and the powers at Disney listened. He suggests that everyone he and his brother dealt with were very open and accommodating to his ideas and that if Jonas had a problem, it was that he didn’t use his words properly.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-and-amanda-bynes><strong>Miley Cyrus and Amanda Bynes</strong></h2><p>Despite the fact that <a href=#>Amanda Bynes</a> was never on the Disney team, she was part of that Disney crew in during her run with Nickelodeon. One of her friends during that time was Miley Cyrus, who was blowing up on her show, Hannah Montana. These two were spotted hanging out a few different times when they were younger and Miley, in an interview on the Hot 99.5 FM radio show, said that she supported Bynes even through the actresses troubled times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, the feud between these two may have seemed like nothing more than a tweet from Bynes calling Cyrus ugly and calling Cyrus' then-fiancé, Liam Hemsworth, gorgeous, but it may go deeper than that. In 2011, Hemsworth and Bynes were seen getting close while on an apparent date.
