"My parents limited what I could watch and listen to, and did not permit me to watch TRL until I was about 13 years old."</p><p>Swift claimed that the phrases "haters gonna hate" and "players gonna play" were "uttered countless times" by her classmates while attending school in Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
