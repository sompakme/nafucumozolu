In fact, he wrote an autobiography called, Behind The Mask, where he illustrates the physical and mental battles that Fury faced to become the dominant boxer that he is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 6'9, 250 lbs, two-time heavyweight champion lives and breaths working out; not only to becoming a better boxer but as a better person. Fury stated, "working out helps with battles of mental health," in which Fury battled depression and drug usage for over two years in the midst of his boxing career.</p><p>For someone to workout every day, repetition is important but can also become boring and uninteresting. Fury and his numerous trainers attempt to diversify Fury's workouts depending on his body needs, his boxing skills, or to simply allow the boxer to have some fun.</p><h2 id=dirty-keto-diet><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dirty Keto Diet</span></h2><p>For a fighter with the size of Tyson Fury, it's expected for him to burn off around 2000 calories a day. So a guy of his size and work ethic, he must have an intensive diet to match his lifestyle. A dirty <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keto</a> diet includes low carbs, high fat, and some protein for good measure. This diet leads to drops in weight and insulin levels because the body burns through the fat reserves as a source of energy. This diet has helped Fury lose over 138 lbs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=swimming><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Swimming</span></h2><p>A 6'9, 250 lbs heavyweight fighter is not expected to be a fast boxer, but a very strong one. Fury's success comes from his strength in his arms and legs. However, what separates Fury from any other regular fighter, is that he swims. Fury's trainers believe that swimming helps Fury to improve movement and speed. A stiff fighter is a losing fighter most of the time.</p><h2 id=sparring><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Sparring</span></h2><p>Sparring is a form of training in which, the boxers make boxing motions without landing heavy blows. This practice focuses on the technique of the punches thrown rather than the effect that they have on an opponent. Fury can have all the strength in the world, but if he doesn't practice how to throw a proper punch, then he goes into each match as a loser.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 People That Are In Tyson Fury’s Inner Circle (8 That Aren’t)</a></span></p><h2 id=at-workouts><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>At-Workouts</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><span class=item-num>10 </span><span></span></h2><p>During COVID-19, Tyson Fury has used this time to interact with his fans. Obviously an athlete like Fury has a gym in his house, however, he's mindful of his fans, family, and friends who may not. Fury has been engaging in at-home workouts on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> Live with simple bodyweight exercises that everyone can do. These workouts help others as well as help Fury fight against his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mental</a> demons.</p><h2 id=workouts-with-his-wife><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Workouts With His Wife</span></h2><p>An athlete can agree that they never become successful alone. Either family, friends, coaches, or trainers, help athletes get to the next level. Aside from Fury's trainers that help him become a better boxer, Fury's wife is his at-home support system. She engages alongside Fury in the Instagram Live at-home workouts, and she can definitely keep up with the heavyweight champion.</p><h2 id=outdoor-running><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Outdoor Running</span></h2><p>Sometimes, it's healthy for any athlete to workout outside of their typical facility. As big of a guy that Fury is, he switches up his workouts, and runs outside with either his friends or trainers. Cardio is one of the easiest ways to burn fat. Cardio alongside the keto diet helped a lot with Fury losing weight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Tyson Fury Wants To Keep On The DL</a></span></p><h2 id=shadowboxing><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Shadowboxing</span></h2><p>Shadowboxing is exactly as the word describes it, "boxing with a shadow". Many fighters practice shadowboxing to work on technique and different moves to use in the ring. Fury's trainers use shadowboxing often to make Fury practice his punching and balancing exercises. As a two-time heavyweight champion, whatever exercises that he does, seems to be working.</p><h2 id=cycling><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cycling</span></h2><p>For someone to workout every day, as Fury states, "No Days Off", he must diversify his workouts so that he doesn't get bored with his lifestyle. Another form of cardio that Fury exercises is cycling. Outdoor running may not be healthy for Fury's feet, depending on what kind of material that he's running on concrete, grass, turf, etc. However, cycling can be a very intense cardio workout that's good on the body and mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=training-with-sugar-hill-steward><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Training With Sugar Hill Steward</span></h2><p>In December of 2015, Fury started teaming up with Kronk Gym's SugarHill Steward, who is the nephew of legendary trainer, Emanuel 'Manny' Steward. Manny Steward trained several great <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boxers</a> such as Andy Lee, Wladimir Klitschko, Lennox Lewis, Dennis Andries, and Thomas Hearns. Sugarhill Steward helped Fury learn to become a knockout fighter.</p><h2 id=lightweight-training><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lightweight Training</span></h2><p>For those who engage in weightlifting, it's typical to engage in weightlifting exercises in cycles. There are periods of heavyweight lifting to bulk up your body or lightweight lifting to tone up and fix the deterioration in your muscles. While Fury was losing a lot of weight, his trainers made sure to balance between burning weight and maintaining his muscles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There's A Chance Tyson Fury Will Get A Championship Match At WrestleMania</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=training-with-ben-davison><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Training With Ben Davison</span></h2><p>After Tyson Fury stopped working out with his uncle, Fury changed his trainer to Ben Davison. Davison helped Fury get prepared for the first fight against Wilder in 2018. Davison guided Fury between heavyweight and lightweight training, sparring, and swimming, but due to Fury losing the first battle to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deontay</a> Wilder, Fury parted ways with the trainer before the second battle.</p><h2 id=punching-bag><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Punching Bag</span></h2><p>Anyone who's ever aspired to become a boxer, first starts with a punching bag. At any gym, if they have an octagon training or standard equipment set up, then they typically have a punching bag. Punching bags are good for letting off steam, but for boxers, it's good to practice punches and for MMA <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fighters</a>, kicks as well.</p><h2 id=formerly-trained-with-his-uncle><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Formerly Trained With His Uncle</span></h2><p>Tyson Fury <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">broke ties</a> with his uncle, Peter Fury, before Fury's return to boxing in 2018. His uncle may have been a great trainer for boxing, however, what Fury truly needed at the time was a more experienced trainer like Ben Davison and Sugar Hill Steward. Fury's relationship with his uncle is most dismantled and unlikely to be repaired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Man of Many, BBC Sport, The Sun, The Guardian, Instagram</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Pics That Paint Tyson Fury In A Different Light</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZK2xo6S7brLUq7BmnJ%2BawG7AzmaqrZmpYravedKhmKmdXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-hudson-kind-of-liked-false-brad-pitt-dating-rumors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Hudson Kind of Liked False Brad Pitt Dating Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-what-james-avery-secretly-whispered-to-will-smith-during-fresh-prince-s-most-emotional-sc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What James Avery Secretly Whispered To Will Smith During 'Fresh Princes' Most Emotional Sc</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
