I think we have words to depict our resentment genuinely and we believe that is solid inclination that we have. A feeling of misfortune for Janae and her family at the present time. We’re so appreciative and favored that she is alive and that might be the beginning stage for us is that we are grateful that she’s here.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This strong girl and her family need all of the prayers and support of the community.
