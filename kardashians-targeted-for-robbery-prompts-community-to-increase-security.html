TMZ notes that the community went from experiencing multiple burglaries per week to none at all. Moreover, they’ve been able to catch intruders attempting to gain access to the gated community before they can get inside.</p><p>The Kardashian-Jenners have faced a variety of uninvited “visitors” to their properties over the years. Most recently, in January, <a href=#>a man was arrested and charged after showing up to Kim’s home</a> in December. Kim was also granted a restraining order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jomonie Victor Zigler apparently had a history of trying to make contact with the reality star. During the December incident, he was able to show up in front of her house before being stopped by Kim’s security team.</p><p>The trespasser reportedly wanted to give the SKIMS founder a diamond ring and is known for referring to Kim as his “wife” online.</p><p>Kim went through a similar experience in 2021 when a different man, Charles Pete Zelenoff, tried to make contact to give her a diamond ring, too.

She’s also had millions of dollars in jewelry stolen on different occasions. Most infamously, Kim was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016. Thieves were able to make off with a variety of her jewelry, including a $4.5 million ring gifted by her then-husband Kanye West.</p><p>One of the men who was sentenced to jail time in connection to the robbery later shared what motivated him to do it. Apparently, the catalyst was seeing Kim flaunt her wealth online.</p><p>“Since she was throwing money away, I was there to collect it, and that was that. Guilty? No, I don’t care,” <a href=#>Yunis Abbas said in a video interview with VICE</a> last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I went on the internet, and it’s true, I saw her jewelry, I saw her ring, I saw that she showed it everywhere, and we knew this information through social media,” he continued.</p><p>Needless to say, with their history of stalkers and thieves, the Kardashian-Jenners are probably grateful for extra security in their gated communities.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Former Bond Girl Eva Green Wins $1 Million Over Failed Movie 'A Patriot'</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>VICE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qaqZ2Zo522orrSZquaqpeawaawjJ%2Bmq2WipK%2BjsdGyZKmqn6K9tb%2BMnKampaWjtrXFjK2mZqGemL%2BmrdKeZKydk6q%2FqsDYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-david-crosby-s-wife-have-to-say-about-his-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Does David Crosbys Wife Have To Say About His Death?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./d-l-hughley-net-worth-age-height-wife-family-wiki-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>D.L.
