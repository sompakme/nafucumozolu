Although he does his best to stay out of the limelight, it hasn't stopped his success as a comedian, an unexpected actor, and even a rapper. His breakout role came in 2000 in the second installment of<a href=#> rapper/actor Ice Cube's</a> stoner comedy film, Next Friday, which grossed $59 million at the global box office. While his jokes and actions have landed him in trouble with the law, Mike Epps has still managed to amass a $8 million net worth in addition to a lavish lifestyle. Here is a look at Mike Epps' insane car collection.</p><h2 id=1964-buick-riviera---70-000>1964 Buick Riviera - $70,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a middle-aged man with a multi-million-dollar bank account, Epps can afford to buy himself a few trinkets for all his hard work in making others laugh. While he may not have the boastful real estate portfolio of his <a href=#>fellow comedian and original Friday star, Chris Tucker</a>, Epps has done well for himself in his profession. He is especially proud of his car collection, which consists of one of his most prized vehicles, a 1964 Buick Riviera. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Automotive Mileposts</a>, the vehicle is powered by a 425 cubic inch 340 horsepower engine, but the custom finishing done by Epps is what made this classic automobile truly unique. In addition to its light-gold painted color, he decked the interior out with Gucci headliner and suede, matching the golden exterior and bringing its overall price to $70,000.</p><h2 id=2013-range-rover---125-000>2013 Range Rover - $125,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The popularity of Range Rovers <a href=#>among Hollywood celebrities</a> and even Her Majesty the Queen has been broadcast through rap and pop songs for years now. Not only are they epitome of style and class in a luxury SUV, but the 5.0 liter V8 supercharged engine with 8-speed automatic transmission that peaks at 510 horsepower, giving it speed and swiftness that stands out compared to other SUVs in its class. With ability to reach 0-60 MPH in only 5.1 seconds, it's no wonder adrenaline junkies like James Bond's star actor Daniel Craig and <a href=#>soccer legend David Beckham</a>, as well as renowned music artists like Justin Bieber and the rap extraordinaire Jay Z also keep a Range Rover in their garage, according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Hollywood Reporter.</a> The 2013 model would've run Epps roughly $125,000.</p><h2 id=2013-rolls-royce-ghost---246-500>2013 Rolls Royce Ghost - $246,500</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Undoubtedly the most expensive luxury vehicle on Epps' garage list, the 2013 Rolls Royce Ghost is another staple in the car collections of the rich and famous. The massive four-door Sedan is backed by a twin turbo 6.6 V12 engine, boasting 563 horsepower with 8-speed automatic transmission. And, as you might have expected, only the wealthiest celebrities and media personalities own this elite specimen of a vehicle, from <a href=#>GTM Boxing Promotions CEO Floyd 'Money' Mayweather</a> and Shaquille O'Neal to Jennifer Lopez and Kylie Jenner. Despite being of an older model, the average price tag on the 2013 Rolls Royce Ghost is $246,500.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:<a href=#> Sweet 16: Inside Floyd Mayweather's Jaw-Dropping Car Collection</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=1932-ford-t-bucket-hot-rod---70-000>1932 Ford "T-Bucket" Hot Rod - $70,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Resident Evil: Extinction in 2004 starring Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen to All About The Benjamins - there isn't a part you could offer Mike Epps that he wouldn't be able to execute. However, movie parts aren't the only thing he is skilled in. He is also good with car parts and has been<a href=#> spotted on social media</a> showcasing the work of his hands with stunning vehicles he has crafted from start to finish. One of those vehicles is the 1932 Ford "T-Bone" Roadster which he mounted himself, powered by a three-stroke 350 Chevrolet V8 engine with 26-inch wire rims that effortlessly stands out.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Classic Auto Mall</a>, the T-bucket is a two-seater and the front wheels are much smaller than the rear wheels, often using motorcycle wheels. Given all the interior and exterior work Epps did on the Roadster, it would be estimated at $70,000.</p><h2 id=bmw-m850i---200-000>BMW M850i - $200,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite owning a few of the more modern examples of luxury vehicles as per the standard in celebrity circles, it's clear to see that The House Next Door: Meet The Blacks 2 actor has a love for vintage and classic cars. His next beauty is a 1996 BMW 850i which Epps explains in a video that he has brought back to life from scratch using his own hands. Also known as a 1996 BMW 8 Series, the coupe holds a 4.4 liter V8 engine with 282 horsepower at 5700 RPM. The selling for one of these starts at $20,400, but after installing <a href=#>a brand new Rolls Royce</a> interior and a swanky paint job, its value increased to $200,000. Who would've thought that a class act like Epps could be a mechanic?</p><h2 id=1957-chevrolet-bel-air-convertible>1957 Chevrolet Bel-Air Convertible</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike Epps revealed in his car collection interview with GQ that his new car project at the time was a 1957 Chevy Bel-air Convertible which he fitted with a new Chevrolet Camaro custom chrome 6.2-liter V8 engine that can generate up to 520 horsepower and go accelerate from 0-60 MPH in under 6.6 seconds. That's a lot of power under the hood of an old Chevy model, but it's clear that Epps is as passionate about revamping cars as he his about his career as an actor/comedian! At least now we know that&nbsp;<a href=#>Aquaman's Jason Momoa isn't the only person who values cars that look like they were featured in an Elvis Presley movie.</a></p><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>How Mike Epps Laughed His Way To An $8 Million Fortune</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic Auto Mall</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Automotive Mileposts</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmo6inm2K2r7%2FInZxmpZmgsm6xz6mqZqGeqK6vsYycmKtlk6S5rbHCraCopl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adele-offers-58-million-to-buy-sylvester-stallone-s-beverly-hills-mansion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adele Offers $58 Million To Buy Sylvester Stallone's Beverly Hills Mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zooey-deschanel-cozies-up-to-new-beau-jamie-linden-at-emmys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zooey Deschanel Cozies Up to New Beau Jamie Linden at Emmys</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
