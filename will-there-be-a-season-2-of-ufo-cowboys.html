They felt it was the best Hollywood hoax since the&nbsp;Blair Witch Project.</p><p>However, from the filmography, they learned the reality show produced is actually fake. Even they are sad that UFO Cowboys is staged.</p><p>The scene where Jeff gets kidnapped by the government in a white room makes them question more about its originality.</p><p>In the room, he had no film crew or friends with him to video his abduction, but still, they displayed it on the screen.</p><p>They feel it was high when the guy went missing in the light, reappeared, and attacked them without wearing clothes.</p><figure></figure><p>So, they believed it was the same hoax reality docu-drama as the “Blair Witch Project” and others.</p><p>While some pointed out it’s the inferior version of ‘The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.’</p><p>Some say the first episode starts as reasonable, but they didn’t hold back the nonstop action. They had fans until the last two minutes of episode 1.</p><p>Nonetheless, viewers believed the production team had done their research, studied every UFO trope, and then made a reality show that touched on all of them. So, it is a fun ride for UFO lovers.</p><p>Some even appreciate the acknowledgment of extraterrestrials but advised the production team to put a considerable disclaimer on each episode acknowledging this for entertainment purposes only.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-to-watch-ufo-cowboys></span>Where To Watch UFO Cowboys?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>UFO Cowboys is available on The Roku Channel.
