It's not just their money, fame, adoring fans and luxurious lifestyle that have us all sitting in a giant pool of envy. It's also the notion that these celebrities seem to live by different rules and laws than us common folk do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This also applies to&nbsp;the world of dating. Age may only be a number in regards to the matters of the heart, but when we talk about sexual age, then age does matter! Or a least it does to the general population. Celebrities however choose to take a different approach and instead of being escorted away by the police, become the subject of gossip, which in turn&nbsp;gives them and their careers more publicity. With this list we look at celebrities both past and present who have started dating women barely entering adulthood; sometimes even before that!</p><h2 id=15-nick-lachey-and-jessica-simpson><strong>15. Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson</strong></h2><p>The first entry on our list goes to the former king and queen of the reality TV circuit. Back in 2003 <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> and <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a> shared their loving marriage with the world in their TV show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. When the show started it was Lachey that was the star, however, as the show became more popular, and with Simpson playing up to the "dumb blonde" role, it would be Simpson that became the bigger star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But before all of this, we seem to have all forgotten that the former 98 Degrees star started dating Simpson back in the late 1990s when he was twenty five and she was barely 18 years old. At the time she may have claimed to be sweet and innocent and that their relationship was all legal and above board, but that's still some age gap and Lachey was in real danger of robbing the cradle with this one.</p><h2 id=14-tyga-and-kylie-jenner><strong>14. Tyga and Kylie Jenner</strong></h2><p>The Kardashian and the Jenner family are no strangers to publicity and controversy having frequently been at the centre of many of the celebrity storms over the last few years, so it's no wonder that their love lives are equally controversial and publicized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when rapper <a href=#>Tyga</a> split from his long term partner Blanc Chyna he was spotted spending a lot of time with one of the younger members of the Kardashian clan, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>. Although they didn't officially "come out" as a couple until Kylie was 18, friends and family said that they had been close since she was 16, that's a whole two years younger than the legal age of consent. Even spending some time in Europe together, where the age of consent is 15 and 16 didn't stop many people expressing their dislike for their relationship. In particular&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> showed her disapproval, as well as many of the public taking to Twitter to voice their concerns too.</p><h2 id=13-henry-cavill-and-tara-king><strong>13. Henry Cavill and Tara King</strong></h2><p>The next entry on our list may be safe as the girl in question was 19 and over the legal age, but given how close she was to being a minor and the age gap between her and <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a> (He was 33) we feel it deserves a place on our list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When British actor and Superman superstar met student Tara King in a London nightclub, many people were shocked to hear about their relationship. However, as Cavill started taking her to various award shows and confessing to the press how special she was and that age is really just a number, people changed their minds and started saying "awww, bless them." Having said that, after only a year together, Cavill has ended the relationship and moved on. Being linked with many stunning actresses out there, maybe Superman just wanted something younger, or maybe King just needed someone to buy her and her friends some booze!</p><h2 id=12-doug-hutchison-and-courtney-stodden><strong>12. Doug Hutchison and Courtney Stodden</strong></h2><p>Doug Hutchison is known by us all as one of Hollywood's understated, and under appreciated, character actors. With his memorable roles in movies such as The Green Mile, The Chocolate War and Fresh Horses,&nbsp;Hutchison plays weird and disturbing characters expertly. However, it was his marriage to model and reality TV contestant Courtney Stodden that put Hutchison into the limelight more than his acting ever could have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports say that Stodden attended an acting class held by Hutchison and that's how the two met. So with love and passion, the two soon married. However, as Hutchison was 50 years old at the time and Studden was only 16, many people were against their love. With a rocky start to their marriage, the two appeared on Couples Therapy and then after only two years the couple split. Although, if reports are to be believed, the two are back together and planning to renew their wedding vows.</p><h2 id=11-milo-ventimiglia-and-hayden-panettiere><strong>11. Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere</strong></h2><p>In Hollywood land it's surprisingly common for co-stars to hook up or even fall in love. You can't blame them really, especially as they spend a lot of time together and are often put into emotional or even erotic situations. And after all, most of us in the real world meet partners in the workplace, so why not them?&nbsp;That's exactly what happened here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Heroes burst onto our screens back in 2006, the show's two main standout stars were &nbsp;Milo Ventimiglia and <a href=#>Hayden Panettiere</a>. With all the publicity and attention the stars got, it's no wonder they hooked up. However, given that Ventimiglia was 29 at the time and Panettiere was barely 17, the public wasn't so happy for them. Obviously the couple didn't declare anything officially until she was 18 and legal, but we know what these two were up too. Many teenage boys around the world watched Panettiere every week in her cheerleading outfit, but we think this is going too far.</p><h2 id=10-joel-madden-and-hilary-duff><strong>10. Joel Madden and Hilary Duff</strong></h2><p>These days we are so used to seeing and reading about child stars growing up and becoming "bad." Whether they go off the rails with sex, drugs and alcohol or they disappear from the limelight completely, there aren't many good stories to starting in showbiz young. Having said that, there are one or two examples of child stars growing up and becoming normal members of society and <a href=#>Hilary Duff</a> is one of those. Although she did have her bad girl moments, one of those being her relationship with Good Charlotte singer <a href=#>Joel Madden</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former Disney star and singer went public with her relationship with Madden when she was 18 and he was 26, however, there were many reports and stories that they actually met when she was 16 and he was 24. This is not how a&nbsp;star of the Disney channel should behave, but then most of them end up worse so we can't fault Duff for having a bad boy phase.</p><h2 id=9-paul-walker-and-jasmine-pilchard-gosnell><strong>9. Paul Walker and Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell</strong></h2><p>When the life of movie star <a href=#>Paul Walker</a> was tragically cut short, many people were obviously devastated. The Fast and the Furious star was much loved and made a big impact on the big screen in such a small amount of time.</p><p>However, it wasn't just his love of fast cars that got Walker many headlines during his life, it was also his love of chasing younger women that got many people's attention. When Walker started dating long term girlfriend Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell he was 33 and she was only 16. Jasmine was actually closer to Walker's daughter's age than she was to&nbsp;his. The relationship was said to be a loving one and lasted 7 years before its untimely end, but even so... This isn't Walker's only cradle robbing adventure as before Jasmine Walker was dating &nbsp;Aubrianna Atwell who once again was only 16 to his then 28.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-jerry-seinfeld-and-shoshanna-lonstein><strong>8. Jerry Seinfeld and Shoshanna Lonstein</strong></h2><p>During the early to mid 1990s, <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a> could do no wrong. With the success and critical acclaim of his sitcom Seinfeld, there was seemingly nothing that he couldn't do, and that includes dating the youngsters!</p><p>Back in 1993 when Seinfeld was still on the air and making us all laugh, Seinfeld met high school senior Shoshanna Lonstein rollerblading through Central Park. They supposedly fell madly in love with each other, that may well be a sweet story but when Seinfeld was 39 and Lonstein was 17, the story becomes less sweet and more cringing. It wasn't that long after they met that Lonstein turned 18, but we still think the comedian could have met someone more age appropriate.</p><p>The relationship lasted four years before they finally broke it off and Lonstein would go on to become a very successful fashion designer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-james-lowe-and-lorde><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>James Lowe and Lorde</strong></h2><p>New Zealand's most famous and most recent pop star is <a href=#>Lorde</a>. Real name Elle Yelich O'Conner, Lorde shot to fame in 2013 when she became not only the first New Zealand pop star to reach number one on the US Billboard charts, but the youngest too.</p><p>With so much success and fame so young, the attractive Lorde soon became the focus of many people's desires as her love life became public interest. With the tabloids filled with speculation about who she may or may not be dating, it soon became clear that she was in fact in a relationship with 24-year-old photographer James Lowe. As with many entries on this list, the two of them didn't go public with their love until the lady in question turned 18 but we all know they've been dating since Lorde was 17.</p><p>However, if the latest reports are to be believed, then after 3 years of being together these two are heading for a one way ticket to splitsville. If they haven't already arrived, that is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-wilmer-valderrama-and-lindsay-lohan><strong>6. Wilmer Valderrama and Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Wilmer Valderrama</a> could very well have several spots on this list. The That '70s Show star has not only had his fair share of women but he's also had his fair share of the younger ladies too. We start off with his relationship with the then young and innocent <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>. Back in 2004 when Lohan was only 17, and when her star was still shining brightly, these two started dating when Lohan guest starred on That '70s Show. However, they waited until Lohan had turned 18 before they announced their relationship to the world, although Valderrama claimed it was because they wanted to keep it away from the press but we all know he wanted to keep himself out of handcuffs!</p><p>This isn't the only time Valderrama has been seen around the youngsters of Hollywood. Before Lohan came onto the scene, Valderrama met <a href=#>Mandy Moore</a> at a photo shoot. She was 15 and he was 20. Most recently in 2010 Valderrama started a relationship with the then 17-year-old <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>. Does Valderrama have trouble finding women his own age, or at least over the legal age? We think he does. Yikes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-the-weeknd-and-bella-hadid><strong>5. The Weeknd and Bella Hadid</strong></h2><p>The Canadian singer, real name Abel Makkonnen Tesfaye but professionally known as The Weeknd, became one of the success stories to come out of YouTube. Having anonymously uploading music to the site, The Weeknd started to gain some critical success which led to his breakthrough album being released in 2013. Since then he has be going from strength to strength and taking the Billboard charts by storm.</p><p>As well as his music success, The Weeknd has had success in his love life and has been dating model Bella Hadid since she officially turned 18 years old. The Weeknd reportedly told Rolling Stone magazine that he had an interest in Hadid before she passed the legal age. He offered to work with her, wanted the gorgeous model to be on the artwork for Beauty Behind the Madness.</p><p>Although his intentions may have been honourable at first, as soon as Hadid was able to vote they announced their love to the world. A coincidence? We're not so sure and we think The Weeknd may have been a naughty boy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-r-kelly-and-aaliyah><strong>4. R Kelly and Aaliyah</strong></h2><p>We now start to turn to the darker side of fame, celebrity and dating. This entry has everything from underage sex to marriage, pregnancy and a tragic end.</p><p>From a very early age, the talents of <a href=#>Aaliyah</a> started to become known and it wasn't long before the record companies were chomping at the bit to sign her up. So in 1994, when she was only 14 years old, Aaliyah was &nbsp;introduced to <a href=#>R Kelly</a> who quickly became her friend and mentor. With the release of her debut album Age Ain't Nothing But A&nbsp;Number (We know!) people started talking about R Kelly and Aaliyah having a relationship. This came to a head when Aaliyah turned 15 and there were reports that the two of them had run off to secretly get married. There were also reports from people close to the couple that Aaliyah may have been pregnant, however that never seemed to be true. With a marriage certificate stating that Aaliyah was 18, the two cheated the law in order to be together. Needless to say that this was soon annulled by her parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tragically, a few years later Aaliyah died in a plane crash</p><h2 id=3-elvis-and-priscilla-presley><strong>3. Elvis and Priscilla Presley</strong></h2><p>We come now to the king himself,&nbsp;<a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>. Often regarded as one of the most important cultural figures of the 20th century, the King of Rock n' Roll shook his hips through the late 50s until his death in 1977. As well as having a string of hit singles and movies and changing music forever, Elvis also had one of the most famous marriages in showbiz.</p><p>When Elvis met the young Priscilla Beaulieu at a party, she was only 14 years old at the time. It's been reported in many biographies about the King that he in fact had to beg her parents in order to keep on seeing her. Not just because of the age difference, she being under age and him being 10 years her senior, but also because Elvis keeping her out past her curfew. The two married when she was older and had Lisa Marie as their only child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also long forgotten that before Priscilla came on the seen, Elvis was dating someone younger. He really was a Hound dog!</p><h2 id=2-sonny-bono-and-cher><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Sonny Bono and Cher</strong></h2><p>Another celebrity power couple on the showbiz circuit was Sonny Bono and <a href=#>Cher</a>. Before all the plastic surgery and the 80s rock ballads, not to mention the 90s dance tracks, Cher was part of a wholesome partnership with her then husband. The folk duo scored a massive number one around the world with their song "I got you babe." As well as this, they also had their own TV comedy show and were pretty much hard to avoid in the 1960s.</p><p>However, it was actually in the early 60s when the two met as Bono was working for record producer Phil Spector and Cher was doing anything she could to get her big break. So the two became close friends when Cher was only 16 years old and then married not long after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-jerry-lee-lewis-and-myra-gale-brown><strong>1. Jerry Lee Lewis and Myra Gale Brown&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Number one on our list is the mother of all young relationships. The relationship between Jerry Lee Lewis and Myra Gale Brown didn't even pretend to be barely legal. This one was completely illegal and they also kept it in the family. That's right, the popular entertainer married his underage cousin.</p><p>Admittedly, the family connection&nbsp;isn't as bad as it could have been as Brown was in fact Lewis's third cousin twice removed. So they weren't close family but it was still a taboo and bad thing to do. It wasn't just the cousin thing that grabbed the headlines and made everyone slightly sick, it was more to do with the fact that Brown was only 13 years old at the time. To make matters worse, it had only been days after&nbsp;Lewis divorced his second wife that these two got hitched. There were many interviews at the time in which Brown's age was lied about; some say they got married at 14 and some say 15. Either way, this is a relationship that is just wrong on all levels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWoerW0wK1koZmmmnqlrdOem2aakaeyrcWMpZygmZxitKq%2By6xm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-look-back-at-lance-reddick-s-hollywood-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Look Back At Lance Reddick's Hollywood Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-annie-donovan-mother-of-10-month-old-boy-filmed-with-a-vape-in-his-mouth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Annie Donovan, mother of 10-month-old boy filmed with a vape in his mouth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
