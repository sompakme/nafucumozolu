In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tran addressed why this relationship was not good for her</a> during an appearance on The Angie Martinez Show. "I was trying to find my way and trying to make it through somehow, one day at a time," she said. "And now, looking back, I'm like, 'Girl, you were going through it.'
