Don’t even think about coming out with those lyrics.’ And I said, ‘Why not?’ I’m not a diplomat in the United Nations. I’m an artist, and I have the right to work on my emotions through my music,’” Shakira, 46, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> in a profile published on Thursday, September 21. “It’s my catharsis and my therapy, but it’s also the therapy of many people. I know <a href=#>I’m the voice of many people</a>, and I’m not being pretentious, just realistic.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I lend my voice to many women, who maybe also wanted to say the same things I said and perhaps haven’t had the validation to do so. I think songs like the <strong>Bizarrap</strong> session or like the one I did with <a href=#><strong>Karol [G]</strong></a> have given many women strength, self-empowerment, self-confidence and also the backing to express and say what they need to say.”</p><p class=p1>Shakira dropped “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,” a collaboration with DJ Bizarrap, in January. The lyrics <a href=#>immediately reminded many fans</a> about Shakira’s split from <a href=#><strong>Gerard Piqué</strong> </a>and <a href=#>his new romance</a> with <a href=#><strong>Clara Chia Marti</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“I’m not coming back here, I don’t want another disappointment / So much that you pretend to be a champion / And when I needed you, you gave your worst version,” <a href=#>she sings in Spanish</a>. “Sorry, baby, it’s been a while / I should have thrown that cat away / A she-wolf like me ain’t for a rookie.”</p><p class=p1>Shakira — who announced <a href=#>her split from the retired soccer star, 36, in 2022</a>— did not immediately address the lyric speculation. Two months later, she revealed on <a href=#><i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i></a> that writing the “anthem” was <a href=#>crucial in helping her move on</a> from the “very rough year after [the] separation.”</p><p class=p1>Shakira and Piqué were together for 12 years, during which they welcomed <a href=#>sons Milan, 10, and Sasha, 8</a>. The duo confirmed in June 2022 that <a href=#>they called it quits</a> but that their kids’ well-being remained their primary focus.</p><p class=p1>“My priority was my home, my family. I believed in ‘till death do us part.’ I believed that dream, and I had that dream for myself, for my children,” Shakira confessed to Billboard about <a href=#>the demise of her decades-long relationship</a>. “My parents have been together, I don’t know, 50 years, and they love each other like the first day, with a love that’s unique and unrepeatable. … And it has always been my example. It’s what I wanted for myself and my children, but it didn’t happen. If <a href=#>life gives you lemons</a>, you have to make lemonade. That’s what I’m doing: making lemonade.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I think that nothing can compensate for <a href=#>the pain of destroying a family</a>. Of course, I have to keep going for my children’s sake; that’s my greatest motivation. But my biggest dream, more than collecting platinum albums and Grammys, was to raise my sons with their father. Overcome obstacles and grow old together. I know I’m not getting that now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While Shakira’s music <a href=#>allowed her to productively cope</a> with her new normal, she was never trying to create hit songs. “I was trying to work out and understand my emotions in search of a catharsis,” she explained to the outlet.</p><p class=p1>Shakira has since <a href=#>moved on with basketball player<strong> Jimmy Butler</strong></a>. “They’re growing closer every day,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>earlier this month, noting the singer is not rushing to settle down. “Shakira has a lot on her plate. Her main priority is her kids and career. But she’s definitely optimistic about finding love again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqhmZuev6J50Z6drquVmXq1u4ycn5qml5p6tLvNoGSlsaKesLR5wJumrqxdnLKzrdGdZKmhoaqybr%2FEqZirmaSevK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simone-biles-will-compete-in-balance-beam-final-at-tokyo-olympics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simone Biles Will Compete in Balance Beam Final at Tokyo Olympics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./over-the-top-purchases-the-kardashian-jenners-love-to-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Over-The-Top Purchases The Kardashian-Jenners Love To Make</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
