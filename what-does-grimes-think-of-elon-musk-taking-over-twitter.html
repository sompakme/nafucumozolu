But the eccentric duo had a whirlwind relationship, filled with odd tweets and controversial baby names. <a href=#>The pair had two children before splitting this year</a>, right before Elon took over Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Elon and Grimes haven’t been able to share about their relationship online (usually in the form to tweets), that hasn’t been the case recently. There’s been speculation over Grimes’ opinion on his Twitter takeover as Elon continues to face backlash for the new direction he’s taking the social media platform. Here’s what we know about how Grimes truly feels.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Want More Kids After The Birth Of Their Fourth Child?</a></span></p><h2 id=elon-musk-is-making-controversial-changes-to-twitter>Elon Musk Is Making Controversial Changes To Twitter</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s barely been a month since Elon officially took over Twitter, but he’s a made a lot of controversial changes to the site. The billionaire originally announced his plans to buy Twitter as part of a $44 billion deal in April, sharing his hopes of making the platform more “political neutral.”</p><p>"I want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans," Elon shared.</p><p>However, by July, he backed out of the deal saying Twitter had provided him with inaccurate information about spam accounts, which the businessman called a violation of their contract.</p><p>Twitter responded by suing Elon, which included a “$1 billion break-up fee” in case he pulled out with just cause. The lawsuit argued that Elon was trying to pull out of buying the platform due to a drop in his net worth, not because of inaccurate data.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October, <a href=#>Elon changed his mind again</a>, and decided to move forward with the deal, agreeing to buy Twitter for the original price. He took over the platform the following month, and immediately began making huge changes.</p><p>The Tesla founder has implemented a variety of new initiatives to make Twitter more profitable.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Yung Gravy And Addison Rae’s Mom Breakup?</a></span></p><p>Soon after the takeover, Elon announced a paid version of Twitter – what’s being <a href=#>referred to as a premium version of the site</a> – that gives users special perks like a blue verification check.</p><p>These checks were previously reserved for the official accounts of public figures and organizations. But the change now easily allows users to impersonate other people or entities.</p><p>Moreover, Elon controversially laid off almost half of Twitter’s staff in his first few weeks as temporary CEO. He let go of nearly 8,000 employees to cut cost, including high-ranking executives, but is <a href=#>now facing lawsuits related to the surprising layoffs</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many people, <a href=#>including public figures, have deleted their Twitter accounts</a> in response to Elon’s changes. It’s been reported that many advertisers have pulled out, too.</p><p>Elon has admitted that Twitter is hemorrhaging money -- $4 million per day.</p><p>" <a href=#>Regarding Twitter's reduction</a> in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day,” Elon tweeted. "Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required."</p><p>Elon has also sold <a href=#>billions of Tesla stocks since the Twitter deal</a>, including two times that came after he swore he wouldn’t sell more. Some have speculated the deal is taking more of a toll on Elon’s finances than he believed it would.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is reportedly also worrying Tesla investors, who are concerned about how much time he’s spending on the Twitter takeover. To this, Elon has <a href=#>said he doesn’t want to be CEO of Twitter</a> (or any business), and plans to spend less time on the site as he introduces someone new to the role.</p><h2 id=grimes-hasn-t-made-any-comments-on-elon-musk-taking-over-twitter>Grimes Hasn't Made Any Comments On Elon Musk Taking Over Twitter</h2><p>Grimes hasn’t publicly commented on Elon’s Twitter takeover. But she did reveal in March 2022 that they broke up shortly after welcoming their second child via surrogate. In a tweet, the Canadian singer implied that they remain on good terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“ <a href=#>Me and E have broken up *again*</a> since the writing of this article haha, but he’s my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now,” the mother-of-two wrote.</p><p>Several months later, it was revealed <a href=#>Elon had welcomed twins with a top executive</a> at his Neuralink company. Some people speculated this put him on bad terms with Grimes, but she’s never addressed it.</p><p><span class=next-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Travis Barker And Kourtney Kardashian’s Children Get Along?</a></span></p><h2 id=grimes-rsquo-twitter-activity-suggests-she-supports-elon-musk>Grimes’ Twitter Activity Suggests She Supports Elon Musk</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not only her silence that speaks volumes, but also her social media activity. The biggest sign that Grimes has no problem with Elon’s Twitter takeover is that she remains active on the platform. The singer often releases multiple tweets per day. In fact, it’s the platform through which she and Elon originally connected.</p><p>If she felt negatively about the business deal or the changes Elon is making, Grimes likely wouldn’t still be using Twitter.</p><p>However, it’s to be noted they don’t currently follow each on Twitter (<a href=#>this has happened before after their break-ups</a>). That doesn’t mean Grimes has hard feelings about Elon’s antics with Twitter, but she simply may not want to see her ex in her newsfeed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmnquhnZrAbsDHoqWkZZ%2Bbeqa4zqdkpq2joHq1rcqipaBln6uys3nTsKCtrJWnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jos%C3%A9-altuve-s-wife-nina-altuve-her-height-age-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jos Altuves wife Nina Altuve?
