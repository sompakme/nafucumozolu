However, as soon as the video surfaced, he found himself at the center of controversy.</p><p>In the video, Haddon and his wife, Dominique Mctyer, can be seen dancing together. The part that sparked the intense discussion was when Mctyer began twerking on Haddon.&nbsp;</p><p>This particular act sparked a debate among Haddon’s fanbase and followers.&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous individuals expressed their disapproval. People expect him to uphold a certain moral standard.</p><p>His fans argued that such behavior was highly inappropriate for someone in Haddon’s position as a pastor and a gospel singer.</p><p>The criticism towards Haddon and his wife’s dancing video prompted him to address the controversy and share his perspective on the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking to <a href=#>Instagram</a>, Haddon attempted to respond to the criticism respectfully and understandingly.&nbsp;</p><p>He emphasized the importance of learning to disagree without disrespect and acknowledged that people have different opinions.&nbsp;</p><p>Haddon recognized and respected their perspectives, encouraging an open dialogue.</p><p>He drew inspiration from the lyrics of the song “People Make the World Go Round” by the Stylistics.</p><p>Haddon aimed to promote understanding and acceptance of different viewpoints.&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite Haddon’s efforts to foster unity, the reaction to his Instagram post remained divided.</p><p>In July 2013, Deitrick Haddon married Dominique Mctyer, and together they have three children: Destin, Denver, and the youngest, Deitrick.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to his marriage to Mctyer, Haddon had been married to Damita Chandler for 15 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Their relationship faced controversy when Haddon fathered a child with Mctyer before their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Chandler accused him of abandoning her and the church they led together in favor of his current wife.&nbsp;</p><p>This background information added fuel to the fire of the current controversy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Criticism on Deitrick Haddon wife dancing video</h2><p>Many individuals continued to express their outrage through comments, criticizing Haddon for not keeping the dancing video behind closed doors.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>One commenter argued that the Deitrick Haddon wife dancing video contradicted the idea of Christian liberty.&nbsp;</p><p>He also suggested that such behavior was completely inappropriate for a minister like Haddon.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his attempts to promote understanding, many people felt compelled to voice their discomfort with the video.&nbsp;</p><p>Some argued that they had overcome certain behaviors and felt that returning to them was not appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, others expressed concern about the state of the world and the potential influence of such actions.</p><p>Despite the criticisms, Haddon also found support among his followers.&nbsp;</p><p>Some shared their belief that he and his wife had every right to enjoy moments together publicly as a married couple.&nbsp;</p><p>One supporter wrote, <strong>“It’s sad… that people think because you’re saved… you can’t enjoy moments in your life… It’s very obvious that you and your wife… love each other… like each other and enjoy each other… in private and in public… people need to catch up.”</strong></p><p>Another supporter offered, <strong>“I don’t see anything wrong with you dancing with YOUR WIFE!!! People need to stay out of married folks’ <a href=#>business</a>!!! May GOD continue to bless your union.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwxKKrq6GToHqprcOdpqdlp56zpnnDmqWcoZ6cere1w56maA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drakeo-the-ruler-s-estate-was-sued-for-over-100-000-due-to-damages-and-back-rent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drakeo The Rulers Estate Was Sued For Over $100,000 Due To Damages And Back Rent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./attack-of-the-10-most-terrifyingly-destructive-invasive-species.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Attack of the 10 Most Terrifyingly Destructive Invasive Species</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
