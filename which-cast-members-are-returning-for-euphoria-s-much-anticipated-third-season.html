From the way the fashion and make up in the show has influenced an entire TikTok generation, to it coming under fire for its depictions of teenagers using drugs, there is no denying that one way or another the show has captured the attention of many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And the show has been an incredible launching point for many new fresh faces in Hollywood, like Alexa Demie and Hunter Schafer, to name a few. Not only that, but it has done an incredible job at reminding the public what an amazing actress Zendaya is with her emotional and intense portrayal of Rue, the main character of the show who suffers from extreme drug addiction.</p><p>Since HBO has announced that the show has been renewed for a third season, may have begun to speculate who of the original cast will be returning for Euphoria's much anticipated season three.</p><h2 id=barbie-ferreira-has-decided-to-part-ways-with-euphoria>Barbie Ferreira Has Decided To Part Ways With Euphoria</h2><p>Barbie Ferreira joined the cast of Euphoria for its premiere season as Kat Hernandez. The character would quickly become a fan favorite for pushing boundaries and promoting body positivity as one of the few curvy girls on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The characters' season one storyline would capture audiences with its wild twists and turns, but that same spark wouldn't be seen in the second season, allegedly due to tensions on the set between Barbie and the show's director Samuel Levinson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Everything Barbie Ferreira Has Said About Working On Euphoria">Everything Barbie Ferreira Has Said About Working On Euphoria</a></span></p><p>Barbie's character began to get noticeably less screen time in season two, with her character also treating others in a crueler manner. Even still, the actress would speak positively of the character until <a href=#>she eventually announced that she was leaving the show</a>.</p><p>Luckily, she wouldn't have to wait long before landing another role. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferreira is set to appear in House of Spoils</a>, a psychological thriller that is set to premiere through Prime video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-we-know-is-returning-for-euphoria-season-three>Who We Know Is Returning For Euphoria Season Three</h2><p>With Zendaya playing the main character in the show, there is no surprise that she will be returning for season three. The actress was able to <a href=#>step into an executive producer role</a> during season two and is already coming up with ideas for the much anticipated third season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="The Real Reason Zendaya Wants Euphoria To Do A Time Jump In Season 3">The Real Reason Zendaya Wants Euphoria To Do A Time Jump In Season 3</a></span></p><p>According to Elle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunter Schafer is also slated to return for a third season</a> as Jules, a much-beloved character among the Euphoria fandom. Dominic Fike will be joining them as their character Elliot, with Jacob Elordi, Alexa Demie, and Sydney Sweeney all returning to respectively play Nate, Maddy, and Cassie in the story.</p><p>Sweeney told Elle that she was sure her character, Cassie, would be killed off in season two, but the characters' storyline would take an interesting turn instead.</p><p>The actress said she was excited to get deeper into her character's "dark side".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zendaya has also talked about the possibility of including her Tom Holland in season three as a cameo, but nothing has been set in stone for that. Maude Apatow and Algee Smith will also both be returning as Lexi and Chris.</p><p>There is also speculation that Angus Cloud, Colman Domingo, Storm Reid, and Chloe Cherry will be returning, but sources have yet to confirm whether this is true.</p><h2 id=the-actors-39-new-found-popularity-may-be-affecting-euphoria-39-s-release>The Actors' New Found Popularity May Be Affecting Euphoria's Release</h2><p>While the show has been confirmed for its third season, and HBO's Executive Vice President of Programming expressed excitement over the show's renewal, no release date has been confirmed with the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the actors have begun to gain popularity, there is also the possibility that scheduling conflicts could further delay Euphoria's release.

Bloys did, however, also said he would be happy to let Levison figure out a natural end for the show.</p><p>With Euphoria season two's crazy storylines, the incredibly moving cliffhanger at the end of the season, and Barbie Ferreira's sudden departure from the show, it's no wonder that fans are waiting with bated breath for just a hint of the next season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqkrdKtZKadnZeys7%2BMmqmeZZOkuqq6xmaZmpubYrOwvoyerKmgn6e2onnSnpisp55iwam%2BxJ5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wrestler-lex-luger-net-worth-how-much-is-wrestler-lex-luger-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wrestler Lex Luger Net Worth How Much is Wrestler Lex Luger Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-kelce-disses-swifties-as-taylor-swift-s-safety-remains-at-risk-following-stalker-encounter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Kelce Disses Swifties As Taylor Swifts Safety Remains At Risk Following Stalker Encounter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
