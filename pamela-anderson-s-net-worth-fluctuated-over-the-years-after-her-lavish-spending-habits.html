She went on to prove naysayers wrong by carving a name for herself as a model and actress, so much so that, her name grew to become a global brand with several awards and recognition from around the world.</p><p><strong>Pamela's journey to fame made her rich</strong>. But then, things changed. She went from having lots of money to barely being able to afford a place to live for herself and her kids. This article will expose <strong>how Pamela Anderson's net worth changed over the years </strong>due to her lavish spending habits and what she's worth now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-pamela-anderson-39-s-lavish-spending-habits-impacted-her-net-worth>How Pamela Anderson's Lavish Spending Habits Impacted Her Net Worth</h2><p>Pamela Anderson's financial life is a typical example of moving from “grace to grass”. The actress and model experienced a downward movement from <strong>a whopping $35 million net worth</strong>, with two properties in Canada and Malibu, which she acquired at the peak of her career, to living in a trailer park with her kids due to her lack of financial intelligence.</p><p>Pamela had a thing for lavish spending and throwing money into the air for things ranging from, first-class travel, expensive jewelry, gold-decked properties, flashy rides, and a long list of endless parties which involved heavy spending. It was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pamela even spent a fortune just to undergo breast enlargement surgery</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pamela-anderson-s-generous-act-with-her-five-figure-salary-for-a-playboy-shoot-caused-more-harm-than-good-deposit.jpg><p>In 2000, Pamela made what rather seemed like an unwise decision to <strong>renovate her $1.8 million home in Malibu</strong>. The cost of renovation ran into about $8 million, and at the end of the day, she struggled to pay the builders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brandon-thomas-lee-pamela-anderson.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Pamela Anderson’s Son Brandon Lee Reveals Huge “Impact” The Documentary Had On Her Mental Health</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brandon produced the Netflix documentary that allowed his famous mom to share her side of the story.</span><p>After pouring a considerable amount of money into her home, Pamela found herself grappling with debts. In 2012, she decided to rent it out for a hefty $50,000 per month. The following year, she took a bold step and listed it for sale, setting the asking price at an impressive $7.75 million.</p><p>Due to her financial struggles, Pamela had no choice but to move into a one-bedroom trailer that she had initially bought in 2007, intending it to be a guest house. Despite her tight finances, Pamela couldn't resist splurging on renovations for the property. Surprisingly, her efforts proved fruitful, as the trailer was eventually sold in 2018 for an astonishing $1.7 million.</p><p>After Pamela sold her Malibu beach house, she made her official move to her Ladysmith property in 2021 after breaking up with <strong>her ex-boyfriend, French soccer star, Adil Ramil</strong> in 2019. Wanting to give the house a fresh look, she decided to renovate it, costing her about $563,000. The results were nothing short of amazing, earning her a prestigious Ladysmith Heritage Award as recognition for her efforts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In search of better opportunities, Pamela Anderson relocated to Los Angeles, where she got an acting gig on the set of Home Improvement alongside Tim Allen. She interpreted her role on the show perfectly and soon had the attention of the public. After a while, she got a role in Baywatch, which was very popular at that time. <strong>Baywatch received mind-blowing ratings from viewers</strong> and Pamela played an integral role in that success.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brandon-thomas-lee-pamela-anderson.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Heartbreaking Reason Pamela Anderson Won't Wear Makeup Anymore</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pamela Anderson stopped wearing makeup following a huge loss.</span><p>Things were going smoothly for her, but they suddenly fell apart when her finances suffered severe loss due to her lavish lifestyle.</p><p>Pamela's extravagant way of life wasn't the sole reason behind her dwindling wealth. <a href=#>She also encountered a string of debt and tax evasion issues</a> that significantly impacted her finances. According to ABC, state documents revealed that <strong>she owed state tax authorities a staggering $493,144</strong> in unpaid personal income taxes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Pamela Anderson has 2 sons, Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-16.png><p>Additionally, she was hit with a $1.7 million lien. These financial challenges led to Pamela being listed among the top 500 delinquent taxpayers by the Californian government. Nicki Swift reported that <strong>Pamela owed the Canadian government $31,000</strong> in property tax for her home in Ladysmith.</p><p>According to an email obtained by Page Six, Pamela Anderson's former partner, <strong>Jon Peters, whom she was briefly married to in 2020</strong>, revealed Pamela was in such dire financial straits that <a href=#>he had to clear off her debt</a>. Peters expressed frustration, stating:</p><p>I dropped everything for Pam. She had almost $200,000 in bills and no way to pay it so I paid it and this is the thanks I get.

However, fast-forward to August 2021, luck smiled at her, and <strong>she sold the same property for the sum of $11.8 million</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pamela also accumulated a good amount of money from the release of<strong> her 2023 memoir "Love, Pamela",</strong> which contributed to her current net worth. The Memoir, which is a personal narration of Pamela's woes and fortunes, was also adapted into a Netflix documentary. This simply translates to more money for her.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Pamela Anderson's Divorces And Subsequent Settlements Damage Or Build Up Her Net Worth?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pamela Anderson has been divorced multiple times which would normally wreak havoc on anyone's net worth.</span><p>Additionally, <strong>Pamela earns £800 yearly royalties from Baywatch, </strong>according to The Mirror.

While her extravagant lifestyle might have been fueled by youthful exuberance, she's evidently making strides to recover.
