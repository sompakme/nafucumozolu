From Kris Jenner’s famous Christmas Eve parties to Kylie Jenner's lavish getaways to Kim’s temperature-controlled off-site clothing storage space, the Kar-Jenners are the epitome of indulgence — which is fair enough given the empire they’ve built.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We get it. They’re rich. But if you scratch beneath the solid-gold veneer, you’ll find that not only do the Kar-Jenners love to throw money around — they&nbsp;often spend in oddly specific and unconventional ways. Check out some of the quirkier ways the Kardashian-Jenner empire likes to spend their money.</p><h2 id=big-floral-designs---50-000>Big floral designs - $50,000+</h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenners love flowers. Between all of the holidays, parties, and birthdays, the family has been known to spend upwards of $100,000 in one day on custom bundles sculpted into names, animals, and more.</p><p>While most of us would be excited to receive a bouquet on Valentine’s Day, the Kardashian-Jenners wouldn’t dream of it. Venus ET Fleur arranged some of the floral creations we’ve seen blooming on their various Instagram accounts (particularly their names, for whatever reason). For Kim Kardashian-West’s baby shower, she received a Grandiose DE Venus arrangement of the company’s famous Ecuadorian Eternity® Roses, which run three times the size of boring old roses and can last up to a year. The box of roses will set you back a cool $1,500 — and that’s for just over 100 Eternity® Roses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=collecting-birkin-bags---15-000---priceless>Collecting Birkin Bags - $15,000 - Priceless</h2><p>Considered by all of the Kardashian-Jenners to be investments, the famous family loves Birkin Bags. To be fair, we all do — only&nbsp;most of us can’t afford dozens of them. Those who can are often waitlisted for months for the famous bags ranging from $15,000 to $100,000— assuming they pass an interview to deem if they’re suitable to carry the coveted bag.</p><p>Kim’s collection includes Birkins of every color, size, and shape, including the rarest bag of all — The Himalayan. Taking it up another notch — or in this case, clasp — Kanye West gifted Kim with a Birkin featuring custom artwork from the painter behind his 2010 album cover for My Dark Twisted Fantasy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Kardashian-Jenner Closet, Ranked by Luxuriousness</a></span></p><p>And Kris? Let’s just say you should never doubt the OG momager's dedication to her brands. The Kardashian matriarch has a custom neon sign that reads “Need Money For Birkin.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=buying-each-other-cars---1-4-million>Buying each other cars - $1.4 million+</h2><p>What do you get the Kar-Jenner with everything? Cars.&nbsp;In recent years, the whole family appears to have purchased unnecessary cars for each other. Kylie received a $1.14 million push present in the form of a Ferrari from her partner Travis Scott. Not to worry, gift-giving isn’t a one-way street. She recently gifted Scott with a $460,000 silver Lamborghini Huracan. Kris also got a piece of Kylie's luxury car pie in the form of a $515,000 Ferrari for her birthday.</p><p>To celebrate a successful workout experience, Kanye showed up after one of Kim’s exercises sessions with a $240,000 neon green Mercedes G series SUV (which start at $227,000.) She promptly hightailed it to Kylie’s to twin with her own bright orange version.</p><h2 id=huge-displays-of-affection---10-000>Huge displays of affection - $10,000+</h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenners have always had a penchant for being over-the-top, especially when it comes to holidays, birthdays, and any day ending in “y.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last year, Kylie wanted all of Los Angeles — and subsequently, the whole world —t o know she loved Stormi’s dad, rapper Travis Scott, with a West Hollywood billboard reading, “Happy Birthday Daddy.” This display comes right on the heels of Travis Scott’s elaborate V-Day gift when the Astroworld star upped the Kardashian-Jenner' War of Roses by coating Kylie's home with over $50,000 in rose petals for her 22nd birthday.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Expensive Purchases Made By Kylie Jenner</a></span></p><p>It’s been a few years — and a few breakups, makeups, and legal battles later — since Rob Kardashian dated his daughter’s mother, but back in the day, the sock designer sent a birthday message sky-high with a plane banner reading, “Happy Birthday, Angie. I Adore You!!!” Skywriting generally starts at $3,500 and averages at around $8,500, which doesn’t take into account gas fees, and any additional charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cars-for-their-kids---10-000>Cars for their kids - $10,000+</h2><p>Stormi Scott lives one charmed life. The two-year-old Kylie Cosmetic’s heir has her own fleet of cars, including a Louis-Vuitton-monogrammed mini Lamborghini and a pint-sized red Ferrari to match (a few of) her parent's cars, which ring in at well over $2 million. Naturally, if Stormi has cars, the rest of the KarJenner kids ride in style too.</p><p>Both True Thompson and Robert Kardashian's daughter, Dream, have matching itty-bitty Bentleys, while the latter also drives a red Mercedes convertible. The KKW has a garage’s worth of mini cars, including pint-sized Ford F150 ($500+) trucks and jeeps. And remember that aforementioned neon G-Wagon Kanye sprung upon Kim? Kourtney gifted the couple's daughter, Chicago, a matching mini version for her first birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=makeup-collabs---360-million-worth-of-kylie-cosmetics-in-2018>Makeup Collabs - $360 million (worth of Kylie Cosmetics in 2018)</h2><p>Given the youngest Kardashian-Jenner member’s billion-dollar empire, it’s no surprise her siblings — and disgraced friends — wanted to hop on board the beauty brand’s train. Her most recent announcement pairs her with Khloé for the third time, but the makeup mogul has also paired with Kourtney, Kim, and even Kris, whose mini lipstick line is aptly titled “Momager."</p><p>Kim launched her own line, KKW Beauty, which specializes contouring (duh), a few years ago. It’s since seen much success, but there’s no denying the power of partnership lies with Kylie, who released the KKW X Kylie collaboration line soon after. While there's no breakdown of the campaigns, it's safe to say they brought in returns — $360 million. And that's just 2018.</p><h2 id=custom-ensembles-from-labourjoisie---8-000---18-000>Custom ensembles from LaBourjoisie - $8,000 - $18,000+</h2><p>Kar-Jenner lookalike models popped up almost immediately in knock-off versions of Kylie's sparkly 21st birthday ensemble. The skin-tight pink sequin romper was custom-made by LaBourjoisie and valued at $8,000. Similarly, Salameh draped the supermodel on her birthday in a glittery mini dress, of which a similar piece could cost north of $9,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Things People Should Know About Kylie Jenner's Bodyguard Tim Chung</a></span></p><p>In keeping with birthdays, Kylie wore another LaBourjoisie number to her mother’s Gatsby-inspired 60th birthday party. The dress left the billionaire dripping in over 400,000 crystals. The dress’ intricate detailing is breathtaking — though the price tag of $18,000 is what truly takes your breath away.</p><h2 id=awkward-semi-nude-photoshoots---500-000>Awkward semi-nude photoshoots - $500,000+</h2><p>For whatever reason, the Kar-Jenners have a penchant for semi-nude ensemble photos. The five Kar-Jenner children frolicked around a pasture in Calvin Klein underwear for the brand's Fall 2018 Underwear & Jeans Campaign. Other pics from the shoot include a five-person underwear party on a quilt and an awkward shop job of the group in various states of undress.</p><p>Kris has also joined her daughters in various projects and interviews, including one for Cosmopolitan, in which all six Kar-Jenner women are wearing white button-up shirts with no pants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t anything new either. Back when it was just Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney, the girls repped their now-shuttered underwear line in various promotional campaign group shots of them wearing their lingerie.</p><h2 id=big-christmas-trees---7-000>Big Christmas trees - $7,000+</h2><p>Kris Jenner is well-known for her extravagant Christmas Eve parties, so it’s no surprise she’s got X-mas trees for days&nbsp;⁠— but it’s not as though the rest of the Kar-Jenners don’t deck out their homes as well.</p><p>For the 2018 holiday season, Kylie’s theme was all gold everything, complete with a 20-foot tall golden fir tree. The rest of her home was equally ornate and festive, as interior designers carefully placed gold baubles throughout the home. There were also some of the creepiest elves on shelves you’ve ever seen. Khloé, who spent this past year’s Christmas in Cleveland, adorned her giant tree with metallic ornaments and twinkly lights. Her home’s hallways were also decked with mini trees, brass soldiers, and of course, a sleigh-full of presents for True.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matching-with-their-kids-half-off-whatever-their-moms-are-wearing>Matching with their kids — Half-off whatever their moms are wearing?</h2><p>Kardashian-Jenners have long-since been the epitome of “extra,” but nothing demonstrates that better than their mother-daughter matching ensembles. Last year, Khloé and baby True donned similar white numbers designed by Monica Ivena. Khloé's design featured an embellished crop and an over-the-top tulle skirt while True wore a mini version, complete with a matching signature head wrap for Kris’ annual Christmas Eve party.&nbsp;Recently, Khloé and True have been rocking mother-daughter pink sapphire bracelets ($12,700 and $1,700, respectively).</p><p>However, Kylie and Stormi are the true twinners. The mother-daughter duo also matched for the Kardashian matriarch’s holiday party in glittering champagne looks — though the latter’s was much more subdued than her mother, who donned a bedazzled dress with a sky-high slit. We’ve seen the pair match neon swimsuits, costumes, and matching blue ruched dresses. Even one of Stormi’s first publicly shared photos is of Kylie wearing a Fendi romper while pushing a matching Fendi pram ($12,500).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>25 Things Kylie Jenner Spends Her Millions On (That We'd Question Buying)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e86tq2aopaewqa3Snqpmo5GnsaK%2Fx6KYp2WamruvsdFmo6iulWLBsHnMmqKeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shakira-refused-to-change-song-lyrics-about-gerard-pique-separation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shakira Refused to Change Song Lyrics About Gerard Pique Separation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./madison-iseman-mark-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Madison Iseman Mark Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
