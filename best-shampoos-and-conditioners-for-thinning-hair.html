If you’ve noticed that you’ve been losing more hair than usual, one of the first steps you can take is to swap out your shampoo and conditioner for high-performance, targeted products made with proven ingredients. We’ve reviewed some of the most talked about products on the market, and have created the ultimate guide to the <a href=# rel=noopener>best shampoos</a> and conditioners for thinning hair.</p><h2>What Causes Thinning Hair?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there’s no single answer to this question. Hair thinning is multifactorial, and any thinning that you’re experiencing may be caused by factors like stress, diet, illnesses, hormonal fluctuations, or something else entirely.</p><p>While pinpointing the exact root cause of your thinning hair may be a tricky task, there is one thing we are certain of, using well-developed formulas can help restore hair health so that you are better equipped to get hair thinning under control. They’ll nourish the follicles to encourage the growth of healthy, strong hair, and will also fortify current strands to minimize the risk of thinning, split ends and breakage.</p><h2>The Best Ingredients for Thinning Hair</h2><p>There are a few different types of ingredients that you’ll want to look out for when picking the right hair care products for your thinning hair. First, you’ll want to seek out strengthening and nourishing ingredients that fortify the strands and follicles. These types of ingredients ensure the strands are less prone to breakage, split ends and hair fall, and also support the follicles so that they are better able to grow new healthy hairs. Some top ingredients to keep an eye out for include biotin, keratin, amino acids, plant proteins, nutrient-dense oils (such as jojoba, avocado and argan oils) and zinc.</p><p>You may also want to look for ingredients that stimulate the follicles to promote new growth. Caffeine, rosemary and peppermint oil are all great options.</p><p>Ingredients that block dihydrotestosterone (also known as DHT) are also particularly ideal. While not responsible for all forms of thinning hair, this hormone is commonly a cause for hair loss. Two particularly great ingredients for defending against the effects of DHT include saw palmetto and pumpkin seed oil.</p><p>Last but not least, we also suggest looking for formulas that are rich in antioxidants. Antioxidants defend the hair against harmful free radicals from aggressors like pollution and UV rays. These free radicals can damage the strands and scalp and contribute to thinning. Ginseng, vitamin E, aloe and green tea extract are all excellent antioxidant-powered options.</p><h2>The Best Shampoos and Conditioners for Thinning Hair</h2><p>If you’re ready to finally put an end to excess hair shedding, here are our recommendations for the best shampoos and conditioners for thinning hair.</p><h3>1. <a href=#>Blu Atlas Shampoo</a> and <a href=#>Conditioner</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image7-2.jpg><p>The shampoo and conditioner from premium grooming company Blu Atlas are packed with nutrient-dense ingredients that revive the follicles and strands to stop thinning in its tracks and promote strong, resilient hair. We are also impressed by the top-quality, clean formulas, which are vegan, cruelty-free and formulated without sulfates, parabens, phthalates or synthetic fragrances.</p><p>The star of the Blu Atlas Shampoo is vegan biotin, which fortifies the strands and defends them against harmful aggressors so that they are less prone to breakage, split ends and fallout. The biotin also replenishes hydration levels, ensuring the hair is left feeling soft and smooth. It works alongside saw palmetto, which is one of the most effective ingredients for blocking the hair loss effects of DHT. Antioxidant and vitamin-rich aloe barbadensis leaf juice also nourishes and moisturizes, while jojoba protein heals damaged strands. Gentle, coconut-derived surfactants also thoroughly cleanse without aggravating the scalp and follicles or stripping away natural moisture.</p><p>The accompanying conditioner is made with some of our favorite nutrient-rich oils for strengthening, moisturizing and smoothing the hair, including avocado and argan oils.
