However, what many may not realize is that they have&nbsp;much in common. In fact, <a href=#>Sandler was once an SNL cast member himself before he wrote and starred in his first-ever film</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Deuxmoi User Slammed For Alleging Intimate Details About Pete Davidson</a></span></p><p>Since then, Sandler has returned to host SNL and performed some sketches with Davidson. At the same time, the two actors have also been hanging out behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=pete-nearly-worked-with-adam-when-he-was-a-younger>Pete Nearly Worked With Adam When He Was A Younger</h2><p>Back in the 90s, Sandler co-wrote and starred in the comedy-drama Big Daddy. In the film, he plays a law school grad who decides to adopt a kid to impress his girlfriend. The role of the kid eventually went to twin brothers Cole and Dylan Sprouse. What many don’t realize, however, is that Davidson also auditioned for the part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“In 1999, my mom took me to audition for Big Daddy,” the SNL cast member revealed on Instagram as he captioned a behind-the-scenes photo from the time that Sandler hosted SNL. “20 years later I finally got it.”</p><h2 id=pete-looks-up-to-adam>Pete Looks Up To Adam</h2><p>Ever since they became friends, Davidson has nothing but praise for the veteran comedian. “He’s definitely the best,” Davidson said of Sandler during a guest appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers. “Just like caring and sweet and not full of crap. Which is very rare to find.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, Davidson also pointed out that he’s been trying to emulate Sandler. “Also, the way he carries himself I try to follow,” Davidson explained during<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a roundtable discussion for The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “He’s so kind to everyone, and you never hear of a Sandler issue — there’s never like a Sandler-gate. Any time you see that guy’s face, it’s associated with smiles and good vibes. That’s the thing I’m trying to follow.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Best John Mulaney And Pete Davidson BFF Moments</a></span></p><p>Not only that, Davidson also sees Sandler as his personal style icon. “I pretty much just took whatever Adam Sandler was wearing and have tried to do that, because he's my favorite fashion icon,” Davidson explained during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Popsugar</a>. “If you look at any photo of Sandler on a set, or when he's in his regular clothes, he's just the coolest, most confident and comfortable person you'll ever see. I've tried to adapt that type of style now.”</p><p>Today, Davidson and Sandler are also as close as can be. “I’m pretty tight with the Sandman, which is the coolest thing I ever get to say,” Davidson said. “He’s just such a cool, nice guy. I can’t explain how wonderful of a person he is.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-teamed-up-while-everyone-was-in-quarantine>They Teamed Up While Everyone Was In Quarantine</h2><p>As it turns out, not even a pandemic can stop Davidson and Sandler from doing something fun together. In fact, they teamed up for the Quarantine Song. Davidson came up with the idea and immediately checked if his comedian friend would be willing to sing along too. “I just reached out and texted him and was like, ‘Hey, is there any shot you would ever want to do a song together?’” Davidson recalled. “And he was like, ‘Hell yeah, buddy’ and it was awesome.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The Real Reason Pete Davidson Hated Ariana Grande’s Vogue Cover</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon, the two men worked on the song virtually. “We just sent each other notes back and forth and he came up with that great verse,” Davidson revealed. “It just fell together. I was really thrilled.” The video also features Sandler hanging around his home with underpants on his face. At some point, the actor sings, “I’m so bored I’m doin’ songs with Pete.”</p><h2 id=pete-also-consulted-with-adam-on-a-possible-career-move>Pete Also Consulted With Adam On A Possible Career Move</h2><p>Especially in recent weeks, <a href=#>there has been talk of Davidson making his exit from SNL</a>. As it turns out, the actor has been contemplating on making a departure lately. In fact, Davidson recently remarked, “I’m surprised I made it to seven. I’m ready to hang up the jersey.” The actor also lamented that when it comes to materials on the show, “so few come my way that I have to do them all.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Davidson also revealed that he’s even consulted with Sandler about leaving the long-running sketch comedy show. The advice that Davidson got was that he has to time things perfectly. “You don’t ever want to pull the trigger too early,” he explained while speaking with Charlamagne Tha God on a YouTube show. “Everybody’s always been like, ‘You’ll know when you know, and it’ll be all right.'”</p><p>At the moment, Sandler and Davidson are yet to do a film (or series together). That said, it is worth noting that both men have ongoing projects with <a href=#>Netflix</a> with Davidson set to star in the film I Slept with Joey Ramone and Sandler’s Netflix deal extended in 2020. Hence, it may be possible for these actors to finally do a film together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, Davidson has always been a fan of the Sandler-verse. “I like what Sandler did where he’s like, ‘These are my eight friends, we’re going to do this formula for the next 30 to 50 years.’ He built this entire universe for himself, and he’s in his own lane.” Perhaps, Davidson will become a part of it soon enough.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Pete Davidson’s New Girlfriend Just Changed His Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6sbHTnmSdmaaesbS7zWaYp5xdlrGiuYysmKecnJq%2FtHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-there-be-a-season-2-of-ufo-cowboys.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will There Be A Season 2 Of UFO Cowboys?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-most-expensive-junk-foods-in-the-world.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Most Expensive Junk Foods in the World</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
