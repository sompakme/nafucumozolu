She partnered with the brand to release an energy drink earlier this summer.</p><p>Earlier this year, Kardashian <a href=#>detailed her workout regimen</a> via Instagram, revealing in March that she works with fitness specialist <strong>Senada Greca</strong> to “lift weights for two hours daily and do 5 or 6 days a week.”</p><p>The Kardashians star started out with a goal “to gain muscle and be strong,” which she quickly achieved.</p><p>“I see such a difference already,” she wrote. “I’m proud of our commitment together. It always starts with small goals 💪🏼.”</p><p>In October 2022, Kim and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>’s former trainer <strong>Gunnar Peterson</strong> exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>that for the famous sisters, a gym session is “not about the workout itself, it’s about the intensity. They both go for it and they give everything to their workouts.,”</p><p>He added, “That’s why the family is successful. … People don’t realize that they’re super hard workers and if you put that work ethic towards anything and you’re going to have success.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kim-Kardashian-Returns-to-Workouts-After-Breaking-Shoulder2.jpg><p>As Kim gives her all in her physical recovery process, she’s also healing from her drama with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>. The exes — who <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in November 2022 — share daughters North, 10, Chicago, 5, and sons Saint, 7, and Psalm, 4. Kim has been candid about shielding their kids from <a href=#>West’s frequent public outbursts</a> and controversial behavior — and <a href=#>the toll its taken on her</a>.</p><p>“I definitely protected him, and I still will in the eyes of my kids. For my kids. So, in my home, my kids don’t know anything that goes on [in] the outside world,” Kim shared on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast in December 2022, revealing at the time that she was “holding on by a thread.”</p><p>One month later, however, she declared via Instagram that she was starting the new year in her “<a href=#>happy era</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the controversy continues to play out on season 3 of The Kardashians — currently airing on Hulu — Kim is focusing on her career, including <a href=#>a new role on American Horror Story</a>.</p><p>“This project has been months and months in the works, and Kim was ecstatic to finally start filming last month,” a source exclusively told Us in June, prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. “This is an experience of a lifetime, and Kim can’t wait for everyone to see the final product.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qzsdOuqaerXam8bsPOq6KoraRiv7DB06KlnmWRm8GmvoybqZ6Zm567qHnHnqlmq5ikwq2wxKtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./secret-service-living-large-in-30-000-a-month-malibu-mansion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Secret Service Living Large In $30,000 A Month Malibu Mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jacques-torres-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jacques Torres Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
