Since its debut in 1975, it has reached millions of viewers across the United States and has become something of an institution. Following pretty much the same format that it did almost 50 years ago, the series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sees a celebrity guest host</a> while a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">large ensemble cast performs sketches</a> and other variety acts live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <i>SNL</i> is now firmly established in the minds of its fans, there are still plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things that people won’t know</a> about how each episode is made. After all, <i>SNL</i> is such a unique television show that it requires a very&nbsp;specific process for putting each installment together in just a few days with so many different guests and acts.</p><h2 id=saturday-night-live-has-used-studio-8h-since-1975><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Saturday Night Live Has Used Studio 8H Since 1975</span></h2><p>Since launching in 1975, <i>Saturday Night Live</i> has broadcast almost exclusively from Studio 8H. This is a television studio in New York City that is part of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza building. While it is also used by other shows, it is known within the industry as the home of <i>SNL</i>.</p><h2 id=a-new-football-league-once-forced-a-45-minute-air-delay><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>A New Football League Once Forced A 45 Minute Air Delay</span></h2><p>One instance where <i>Saturday Night Live</i> was forced to delay an episode for 45-minutes came in 2001. This was the same year that NBC and WWE launched their own football league in the form of the XFL. The network decided to broadcast a match in its entirety, ensuring that <i>Saturday Night Live</i> could not air at its normal time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=another-episode-was-taped-and-broadcast-two-weeks-later-due-to-a-world-series-final><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Another Episode Was Taped And Broadcast Two Weeks Later Due To A World Series Final</span></h2><p>Very few episodes of <i>Saturday Night Live </i>have ever been canceled or postponed. But exactly that did happen back in 1986. The episode was scheduled to air on October 25, but was delayed due to the World Series game taking place at the same time. The show was taped and shown two weeks later.</p><h2 id=mary-ellen-matthews-is-responsible-for-all-photography-for-the-show><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Mary Ellen Matthews Is Responsible For All Photography For The Show</span></h2><p>Almost all the photography on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> is handled by just one person. Mary Ellen Matthews has worked on the show since 1993 and took over the photography duties from Edie Baskin in 1999. She is responsible for photoshoots, commercial bumpers, and even directing some video footage.</p><h2 id=most-sketches-and-scripts-are-written-in-just-a-day><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Most Sketches And Scripts Are Written in Just A Day</span></h2><p>The vast majority of sketches and other material for <i>Saturday Night Live </i>are written in just one day. The team will meet on Monday to discuss ideas and then write up scripts on Tuesday. Changes might occur after the table read of the material, but most of the significant writing will be completed by Wednesday morning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-first-read-through-of-material-happens-on-wednesday><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The First Read Through Of Material Happens On Wednesday</span></h2><p>The first read-through of material takes place on Wednesday. This is the first time that the cast, writers, and producers all sit down together to see what they have to work with. It is after this that&nbsp;which sketches are to be included in the upcoming episode are decided upon.</p><h2 id=the-cast-usually-only-get-two-days-rehearsal><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Cast Usually Only Get Two Days Rehearsal</span></h2><p>The tight schedule that everything works at on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> means that the cast members have very little time to rehearse what they are due to perform on the show. Once scripts have been written and chosen, the performers will often only get two days of rehearsal.</p><h2 id=sketches-can-be-removed-at-any-stage-after-rehearsal><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sketches Can Be Removed At Any Stage After Rehearsal</span></h2><p>Even after a sketch has been selected for inclusion, it doesn’t mean that they will make it into the show. At any point before the show airs, a sketch may be dropped, changed, or rewritten. That means that the cast members often have to keep rehearsing a sketch as it is altered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=photo-shoots-for-commercial-bumpers-are-completed-by-thursday><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Photo Shoots For Commercial Bumpers Are Completed By Thursday</span></h2><p>In order to get photographs prepared and ready for commercials, bumpers, and for other promotional material, they need to be completed by Thursday. That means that photoshoots take place a full two or three days before the show is actually broadcast, requiring guest hosts and musical acts to show up early.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 SNL Hosts Who Were Jerks (5 Who Were Sweethearts)</a></span></p><h2 id=kenan-thompson-is-the-longest-running-cast-member><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kenan Thompson Is The Longest-Running Cast Member</span></h2><p>Kenan Thompson is now the longest-serving cast member on <i>Saturday Night Live. </i>He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joined the show back in 2003</a> and has been a series regular ever since. That means he has been involved in 17 seasons of the show and is now the most senior performer on the series in terms of age.</p><h2 id=for-most-of-the-show-s-history-snl-only-aired-live-to-certain-locations><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>For Most Of The Show’s History,&nbsp;SNL Only Aired Live To Certain Locations</span></h2><p>Throughout most of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>’s history, the show was not broadcast around the United States live. Only those watching on NBC's station in Eastern or Central time zones were able to view the series live. Everyone else was given a recorded broadcast that would air at 10:30 p.m in their respective time zone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Michael Che Became Co-Host On SNL's Weekend Update</a></span></p><h2 id=the-studio-gets-millions-of-dollars-in-subsidies-from-new-york-state><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Studio Gets Millions Of Dollars In Subsidies From New York State</span></h2><p>Because <i>Saturday Night Live</i> is filmed in New York, the studio can get subsidies from New York State. This is largely because of the extra revenue and jobs that the show provides in the local area. According to official data from New York State, these subsidies can run into millions of dollars.</p><h2 id=since-2017-the-show-has-been-broadcast-live-across-the-us><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Since 2017, The Show Has Been Broadcast Live Across The US</span></h2><p>Prior to 2017, the show was not broadcast live across the United States. As part of the 42nd season, four episodes were broadcast simultaneously across the country. This change was made permanent from season 43 and onwards as the producers felt that things like social media would now spoil jokes before people could see the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 SNL Stars With The Longest Run (And 5 Who Lasted Only One Season)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-guest-host-s-opening-monologue-is-often-written-on-saturday><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Guest Host’s Opening Monologue Is Often Written On Saturday</span></h2><p>As part of the writing process, the opening monologue is not given much priority. In fact, it is commonplace for the dialogue to be written last on Saturday afternoon. This is mainly because it is easier to do than the sketches and other scripts, but it also gives the writers the chance to respond to any very recent events that take place that day.</p><h2 id=the-crew-need-to-quickly-change-the-set-after-opening-monologues><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Crew Need To Quickly Change The Set After Opening Monologues</span></h2><p>Due to the fact that the opening monologue takes place on the same stage as the cold open, it forces the crew into a very quick change. They have to completely swap the set and prepare for the opening monologue in just a minute or so while the opening credits play, as can be<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> seen in this Youtube video</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The SNL Hosts Who Caused The Most Controversy (So Far)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqylp7GixYynoKCgpGK5qsLEZq6hmaRis6K60mabqKakYrivu9ZmmJunpal6p7XLpqCnn18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lee-russo-ben-mankiewicz-age-wiki-biography-wife-explore-lee-russo-wiki-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Lee Russo Ben Mankiewicz Age Wiki, Biography Wife, Explore Lee Russo Wiki Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./these-are-the-biggest-artists-discovered-by-dr-dre-and-their-net-worths.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>These Are The Biggest Artists Discovered By Dr. Dre And Their Net Worths</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
