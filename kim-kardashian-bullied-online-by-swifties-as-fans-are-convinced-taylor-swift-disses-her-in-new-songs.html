"The way I can celebrate is by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the past two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19th," she said of what fans could expect. "It’s called The Tortured Poets Department and I’m going to go post the cover right now backstage."</p><p>Needless to say, fans are thrilled the new album has arrived and they’re having fun debunking hidden Easter Eggs in the tracks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmKvtrjLopydZZ%2Bjuaq6xGaqsKGWqbamv4yfmKerXZi8r8LIp5qenF2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8FusMisqp6rXZ2ys3nNnq5mq5%2BjtLR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-saddest-celebrity-deaths-of-the-new-millennium.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Saddest Celebrity Deaths Of The New Millennium</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaylee-stoermer-coleman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biograp.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kaylee Stoermer Coleman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biograp</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
