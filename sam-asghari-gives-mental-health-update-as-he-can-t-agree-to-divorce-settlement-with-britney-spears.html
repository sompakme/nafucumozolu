With age comes wisdom and life experience,” Sam, 29, continued. “The next year is gonna be a lot of personal growth, a lot of focus on career, and acting specifically. And that’s it.”</p><p>When asked if he’s looking to get back into the dating game, Sam denied having that on his mind (which isn’t the first time he’s said “no” to dating rumors since leaving Britney). “I’m not looking for a partner,” he responded. “I have a partner at home waiting for me.

Despite the estranged couple appearing civil, they’ve yet to officialise their divorce, which suggests they’re struggling to reach an agreement.</p><h2 id=sam-and-britney-rsquo-s-prenup-could-entitle-him-to-nothing>Sam And Britney’s Prenup Could Entitle Him To Nothing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sam-asghari-s-reaction-revealed-after-britney-spears-dances-with-shirtless-men-during-divorce-party.jpg><p>Britney and Sam signed a prenuptial agreement before their 2021 wedding (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">despite claims that Sam was initially hesitant</a>).

For now, the exes’ divorce negotiations are being kept under tight wraps.
