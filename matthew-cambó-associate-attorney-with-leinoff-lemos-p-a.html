He has been recognized by Best Lawyers in America 2022 due to his exceptional focus on serving clients in family law matters.</p><p>Mr. Cambó has a bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law. He is licensed to practice in Florida and is a member of the Family Law and Young Lawyers sections of the Florida Bar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matthew, what makes you different than other professionals in your field?</h2><p>The relationships that I create with my clients. I strive to provide them with the best advice I can based on the unique circumstances of their particular case, not just a generic or formulaic recitation of advice previously given, which only serves to appease the client and ensure the next bill is timely paid.</p><p>While I recognize the professionals in my field may rightfully seek just compensation for the services they provide to their clients, which I certainly have no qualms with.</p><p>There are plenty of attorneys who will compromise the advice they give to their clients if it increases their chances of generating additional <a href=#>business</a>. In my field of law, i.e., family law, we often deal with clients who are going through one of the most difficult experiences of their life.</p><p>When such a vulnerable person places their trust in you, I am honored to receive the opportunity to counsel him or her through their difficult situation to the best of my ability.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>This makes a lot of sense, Matthew. How much potential market share can you achieve in the next 3 years?</h2><p>I’m fortunate enough to work at a premier boutique firm in South Florida specializing in family law. We receive plenty of work, and we seem to grow each year. I’ve certainly seen my responsibilities and personal caseload increase significantly each year as I continue to gain more experience and exposure to larger cases with more complex issues.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are only so many hours in the day, so even though there are obvious limitations to the amount of business an hourly attorney can generate each year, there is always room to improve the quality and efficiency of the work you perform.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was the most important part of your professional journey?</h2><p>When I became a lawyer, I would say about a couple of years in, I handled my own trial for the first time, which showed me how my entire profession works. It showed me how my specific area of law and all of the different components or sub-areas of my particular area of law fit into place and work with each other.</p><p>Once all of that clicked, it elevated my ability to analyze the entire case as a whole and then tactically implement my strategy.</p><p>It also gave me invaluable practical experience in terms of learning how to prepare effectively, learning how long everything takes to complete, and even learning how much effort and time is really needed just to coordinate and complete some of the seemingly easier tasks necessary to prepare your case for presentation.</p><p>Those intangibles can’t be taught in law school, even in the best litigation classes with a simulated trial.</p><p>You can practice your cross-examination as much as you want, but until you get a live witness in front of you who has their own agenda that is contrary to yours, you won’t truly know how effective you will be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best purchase that you’ve ever made?</h2><p>Recently, one of my best purchases, I would say, is my Bose <a href=#>noise-canceling headphones</a>. When you’re working in a tight space with other people who are on the phone or who are dealing with a dog or a child or have to listen to somebody doing renovations to their office or condo, or whatever, I can put those headphones on, escape from all of the distractions and noise surrounding me, and focus on my work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What takes up too much of your time?</h2><p>Administrative work, things that just need to be done but don’t require lawyer skills to do, whether it’s reformatting PDFs or reformatting a Word document so that the substance meets the professional view of the document.</p><p>Even when the substance of your Motion is perfectly crafted, if it looks like it was prepared by a caveman, you will instantly lose some credibility.</p><p>Other examples include: having to search for documents that you know you put somewhere, but you can’t find or having to sift through old materials because they’re not organized correctly.</p><p>Just silly things like that can end up eating hours out of your week with nothing to show for it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What three pieces of advice would you give to college students or recent law school grads who want to become business owners or leaders in the field?</h2><p>You have to be willing to put yourself out there, network, and constantly meet people. And get people to recognize you, because even if they don’t remember you after your first meeting, the second, third, or fourth time you see the same people, your name may finally click in their heads, or at a minimum, you will have become recognizable. You never know if and when any person you meet may need a professional in your field, and when they do, hopefully, they will think of you positively and then reach out.</p><p>Likewise, you never know which relationship will be the one that makes a tremendous impact on your life. The old cliché – it’s not just what you know; it’s who you know – is perpetuated by many for a reason.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who has impressed you most with what they’ve accomplished?</h2><p>That would be my mom. She’s also an attorney in my firm. In addition to giving me everything I needed to succeed growing up, she set an incredible example for me and my siblings. Being an active and involved mother of four children, while also being one of the best—if not the best—family attorneys in the state of Florida, and still managing to find time to enjoy her life, is the realistic model of success we should all pursue and would be lucky to attain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What drives you to keep going when it’s really tough?</h2><p>I think of another simple adage that has always resonated with me – “this too shall pass.” Similar to the adage “time heals all wounds,” it is a comment on the temporary nature of many of the trials and tribulations of the human experience. Once I remember these and then remind myself of my long-term goals, which by definition cannot be accomplished overnight, I’m usually able to continue grinding through the tough times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How should people connect with you?</h2><p>You can connect with me on my <a href=#>LinkedIn</a> or visit my <a href=#>website</a></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvzqetnqqjlsGqu81mrqKsmGK6osDToZywZZOWuqO7jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tina-simpson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tina Simpson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keeley-hazell-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keeley Hazell Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
