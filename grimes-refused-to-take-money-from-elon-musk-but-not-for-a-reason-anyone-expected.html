Then they broke up and the news hit the stands of <a href=#>Musk having twins with his new girlfriend (and Neuralink employee)</a>.</p><p>Then Musk and Grimes were back together again – kind of – in what Grimes called a 'fluid relationship that she doesn't expect others to understand'. And then they randomly announced one day that they <a href=#>just had a second child via surrogate</a>, quickly followed by another announcement that they had “broken up again.”</p><p>The pair sure knows how to give the public vertigo!</p><p>So given all this, it's no secret that Grimes and Elon Musk's relationship is quite different from his relationships with the other women in his past.
