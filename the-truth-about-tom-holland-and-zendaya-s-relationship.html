The film was Holland's first stand-alone film as Peter Parker, but fans first got to see him in action as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War. Zendaya was cast as MJ in Spiderman: Homecoming, Parker's good friend and the girl willing to follow him into turmoil.</p><p>While her character didn't start off as a heavy 'love interest' for Peter, there was certainly a connection between them, likely because of the friendship the two shared off the screen. The bond they share happened quickly, and it's authentic - it's also something they both care a lot about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Holland, in a GQ interview, spoke of being private with his relationships for many reasons, fans have long been questioning the bond between Zendaya as a...

These days, Zendaya can be seen wearing an insignia ring that has "TH" on it, for Tom Holland and the two have been taking vacations together. First, in March it was in London and then in May, it was Venice.</p><p>Perhaps most telling about how happy the two are is Tom admitting in June 2023 that he is "happy and in love," according to 'Buzzfeed'.
