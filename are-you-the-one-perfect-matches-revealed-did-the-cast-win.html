On the Monday, September 9, finale, the final match up ceremony revealed every perfect match — and <a href=#>if the houseguests got it right</a>.</p><p>Going into the finale, they already had five couples figured out. During week 6, <strong>Aasha</strong> and <strong>Brandon</strong> became the first — and only — confirmed perfect match. However, many of the cast used process of elimination to figure out that <strong>Basit</strong> and <strong>Jonathan</strong>, <strong>Jenna</strong> and <strong>Paige</strong>, <strong>Danny</strong> and <strong>Kai</strong> and <strong>Nour</strong> and <strong>Jasmine</strong> were also perfect matches.</p><p>That meant there were six floaters: <strong>Amber</strong>, <strong>Kylie</strong>, <strong>Justin</strong>, <strong>Kari</strong>, <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Remy</strong>. Luckily, Amber/Kylie and Max/Kari had the chance to go on a date this week and Amber/Kylie were sent into the truth booth. Although they had bonded and were clearly interested in one another, they found out they were not a match.</p><p>Since that was the last chance for the house to the guarantee a match before the final ceremony, everyone was upset. Kari and Max both said they were 100 percent sure they were a match so the other four had to figure things out. Amber and Justin had a physical connection since the start, but when they all sat down to talk about their real lives — for the first time all summer, apparently — Remy’s personality clearly made more sense for Amber. That said, when most of the <a href=#>cast decided to go skinny dipping</a> later that night, Amber ended up in the Boom Boom room with Justin.</p><p>At the <a href=#>final match up ceremony</a>, everyone had to make their final decision — and they made the right ones! The cast of Are You the One?: Come One, Come All took home $750,000.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see all the perfect matches:</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWv6Z52KisZqyYmnqwusRmp56qlpqwtXnMmqucoJWoerOx1Z6YpZ2UYrGqsIytn55lk5bAtXnWoqVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bbc-responds-to-complaints-over-insensitive-kate-middleton-coverage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BBC Responds to Complaints Over Insensitive Kate Middleton Coverage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20-jaw-dropping-pictures-of-the-ladies-of-metal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20 Jaw-Dropping Pictures Of The &amp;quot;Ladies of Metal&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
