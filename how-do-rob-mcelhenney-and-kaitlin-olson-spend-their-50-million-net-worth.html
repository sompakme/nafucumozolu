The nature-themed event was held under a large sycamore tree in the middle of the ranch. Though nothing is written about what the lavish yet rustic event cost the couple, the ceremony was nonetheless not free.

Enter:<strong> Mac’s Tavern</strong>. Located at 226 Market Street in Old City, Philadelphia, PA (no surprise there), the former Skinner’s Bar now brings to life a small piece of Always Sunny in Philly. Though the McElhenney’s are not the exclusive owners of the establishment, they are definitely the most famous. The bar was also featured in Phillyvoice.com in 2017 after calling out a couple who dared to dine-and-dash in Mac’s with a Facebook post.
