While Mandel constantly teased her for her single status, she proved to be able to handle the jokes. However, it appeared Mandel went too far, to the point that fans noticed on social media.</p><p>At some point,<strong> Sofía Vergara had to shut him down during an episode of “America’s Got Talent.” </strong>Howie Mandel’s joke appeared to be out of place, and she wasted no time showing that she’d had enough. This article will look back at that exchange between the talent show judges, Vergara’s life since her marriage to Joe Manganiello ended and why their union ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-sofia-vergara-handled-howie-mandel-rsquo-s-jokes-about-her-divorce>How Sofia Vergara Handled Howie Mandel’s Jokes About Her Divorce</h2><p>Two months after Hollywood stars Sofía Vergara and Joe Manganiello announced their split, <strong>Howie Mandel made headlines for poking fun at her new status as a single lady.</strong> During a September 2023 episode of the talent competition show, Mandel made one of his jokes about Vergara, leading her to walk off the stage.</p><p>The exchange started off with the judges playing the lie detector game. Sofía Vergara had been on the hot seat, a throne made out of tater tot props. After going through a few questions, it was Howie Mandel’s turn to quiz her, so he said to her: “Do you see anybody in the audience tonight that you’re interested in?” The audience erupted into loud cheers as some people showed their interest in the “Modern Family” actress. Vergara proved to be a good sport as she replied, “That’s it,” signaling that she was done with the test. It is pertinent to note that <a href=#>Vergara knows how to call out uncomfortable situations</a>, but in Mandel's case, she waved it off with a smile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/976ECCDC-E26A-45E4-9D09-DAE3FF6DE279.jpeg><p>The "Despicable Me 4"<strong> actress took off the lie detector test cuff before walking off the stage. </strong>Sofía Vergara handled the situation well, but her fans reacted differently on social media. Prior to the polygraph test episode, <strong>Howie Mandel threw another jovial jab at her single status during an audition session</strong>.

Howie Mandel spoke at this point, stating that Brynn Cummings could have asked Sofía Vergara because she was “in the market.” “If I have one word of advice, if you’re looking for eligible bachelors, you should have talked to Sofía because she’s in the market right now.” The show’s anchor, Terry Crews did not agree with Mandel as he relayed, “No, no. We are not doing that here.”</p><p><strong>Many fans frowned at the TV star’s joke, labeling it a “low blow.”</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">One person commented on X, </a>“I can’t be the only one who thinks this episode of #AGT is weird as f*ck right???

When asked about the “most challenging” part of the dating scene, the “Griselda” star replied, “Everything.” <a href=#>The richest Modern Family cast member </a>gave her reason for this answer, noting that “everything gets so exaggerated… not interpreted in the right way.” She explained further:</p><p>“So life is already hard. Having relationships is hard. Problems are hard,l. And then to see it out there and be completely changed, you want to be like, 'What is going on?'

After her split with Joe Manganiello, <strong>the “Hot Pursuit” actress was romantically linked to Justin Saliman, an orthopedic surgeon.</strong> Vergara was first linked to him in October 2023 after she underwent major knee surgery. Joe Manganiello and the “Machete Kills” actress ended their marriage after seven years, with the “Magic Mike” actor citing “irreconcilable differences” in divorce documents. The former couple shared a joint statement to announce the “difficult decision.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-02t090537-077.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the "One Tree Hill" actor filed for divorce, he requested that spousal support should be terminated for both parties. <strong>He listed that he and Sofía Vergara signed a prenup during their wedding,</strong> and in a separate filing, the actress asked the court to uphold the terms of their prenup.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sofia-vergara-outside-agt-in-2023.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sofia Vergara Had This Issue With Joe Manganiello Early In Their Relationship">Sofia Vergara Had This Issue With Joe Manganiello Early In Their Relationship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Even years ago, Sofia Vergara had some issues in her relationship with Joe Manganiello.</p><p>In January 2024, Vergara sat in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País, revealing why she and Manganiello ended their marriage.

"When my son becomes a dad, let him bring the baby to me for a while, and then I’ll give it back to him and go on with my life…”</p><p>Over time, both parties moved on with their romantic lives. <strong>Manganiello started dating actress Caitlyn Connor,</strong> while Vergara posted a snap subtly confirming her relationship with Justin Saliman.
