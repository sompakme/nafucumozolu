Fox</strong></a> is <a href=#>opening up about his career</a>, life and <a href=#>Parkinson’s disease</a> in <i>STILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie.</i></p><p class=p1>“I decided to create this documentary for a couple reasons, first <a href=#>bringing awareness to this disease</a> has been very important to me for years and I wanted to continue that work through film,” Fox, 61, exclusively reveals in the newest issue of&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>. “The second is for my fans. They, along with my family, [has][have] been the reason I have been able to go on. As I say, my fans gave me life and <a href=#>I wanted to be open about mine</a>.”</p><p class=p1><i>Still</i>, which premieres on Apple TV+ on May 12, recounts <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Back to the Future&nbsp;</i>star’s life and career</a> in his own words. The film&nbsp;—&nbsp;directed by <strong>Davis Guggenheim</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;uses documentary, archival and scripted elements to revisit Fox’s most impactful memories.&nbsp;<i>Still</i>&nbsp;debuted at the <a href=#>South by Southwest</a> festival earlier this month, <a href=#>earning a standing ovation</a> from the crowd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/michael-j-fox-wants-to-be-open-about-his-life-parkinsons-disease-in-still-documentary.jpg><p class=p1>“Michael has felt like this <a href=#>has been an amazing experience sharing his story</a>. He is getting to connect with fans like he never has before and it’s filling him with such joy and promise,” a source close to the Canada native tells&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “Michael has always been very connected and lifted up by the Parkinson’s community and this has been no different. All of his biggest supporters from his foundation were at SXSW and were involved in the documentary as well.”</p><p class=p1>Fox first revealed in 1998 that he had been <a href=#>diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson’s disease</a> seven years earlier when he was 29. The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Teen Wolf&nbsp;</i>star</a> has <a href=#>since become an advocate</a> for Parkinson’s research and launched his eponymous foundation in October 2000. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research has become the largest nonprofit source of funding for Parkinson’s disease research in the world, per the organization’s <a href=#>website.</a></p><p class=p1>“You deal with the condition, and you deal with people’s&nbsp;perception&nbsp;of the condition,” the&nbsp;<i>Spin City&nbsp;</i>alum — who retired from acting in 2020 amid his health battle — <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>AARP&nbsp;</i>in their March 2017 issue</a> of his diagnosis. “It was easy for me to tune in to the way other people were looking into my eyes and seeing their own fear reflected back. I’d assured them that, ‘I’m doing great’ — because I was. After a while, the disconnect between the way I felt and the dread people were projecting just seemed, you know,&nbsp;funny.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/michael-j-fox-wants-to-be-open-about-his-life-parkinsons-disease-in-still-documentary-inline-01.jpg><p class=p1>He added at the time: “The truth is that on most days, there comes a point where I literally can’t&nbsp;stop&nbsp;laughing at my own symptoms. Just the other morning I come into the kitchen.&nbsp;‘Oh good, coffee. I’m gonna get some! No, wait — I’m gonna get some for <strong>Tracy [Pollan]</strong>’<i>&nbsp;</i>— who’s at the table with the paper. I pour a cup — a little trouble there. Then I put both hands around the cup. She’s watching. ‘Can I get that for you, dear?’ ‘Nah, I got it!’ Then I begin this trek across the kitchen. It starts off bad. Only gets worse. Hot java’s sloshing onto my hands, onto the floor.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Family Ties&nbsp;</i>alum and Pollan, 62, <a href=#>have been married since 1988</a> and share four children: Sam, 33, <a href=#>twins Schuyler and Aquinnah</a>, both 28,&nbsp;and Esmé, 21.
