We all listened to Backstreet Boys and we all had a Walkman. We all played some version of Nintendo and we all loved recess (because school sucked, even though learning was underrated). That’s back when kids actually enjoyed playing outside without electronics. The '90s had its ups and downs, and some of the most amazing movies that have ever been created. One of those movies is Clueless starring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia Silverstone</a>.&nbsp;The movie is an utter classic high school film about Cher Horowitz, a good-natured but slightly spoiled and superficial high school girl who loves to "help" others, whether they want her help or not. It is fun, hilarious, and a feel-good film. It doesn't hurt that the fashion in this movie is amazing, and it encapsulates the 1990s&nbsp;in a&nbsp;way very few movies have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems like a shallow movie that only teen girls like, but it’s far from it. Now, as if to&nbsp;contradict ourselves, we’re going to talk about the absolute best outfits that Cher (Alicia Silverstone) wore in the movie. These outfits are ones that women could pull off today! So get your notepads out and take some notes because your wardrobe is about to get a brand new makeover&nbsp;based on a classic film we all used to watch back in&nbsp;the day.We filtered through all of Cher’s looks and we give you twenty of her very best outfits that need to be brought back in 2018!</p><h2 id=her-capable-look>Her “Capable” Look</h2><p>"Where's my white collarless shirt from Fred Segal! It's my most capable-looking outfit," Cher exclaims as she’s trying to look professional. In this outfit, she goes on a stress shopping spree, but we don’t know why because she looks amazing. She somehow mixes classy, professional, carefree, and fun! The classy shirt, the professional jacket, the carefree skirt, and the fun knee-high tights and silver buckler shoes all look great. We like how comfortable her skirt looks even though she’s trying to look “capable.” It really works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If we had to pick one Cher outfit to add to your wardrobe it would be this one, because it really does go with anything&nbsp;– or rather, any event, from shopping to business meetings to babysitting! The heels aren’t too high, and the skirt isn’t too immodest. It's the perfect balance we all need. Plus, her hair is looking its best here. We need to bring back that no part style.</p><h2 id=plotting-a-romance>Plotting A Romance</h2><p>"Here’s the 411 on Mr. Hall: he’s single, he’s 47, and he earns minor ducats at a thankless job,” Cher stated before deciding he needed to find a girlfriend. In this outfit, Cher played matchmaker (one of her favorite games) for Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. With hair tucked behind her ears, we see just how alluring that beret makes her look. The beret is definitely the shining star, but her pinstripe white shirt is never going out of style.&nbsp;Our personal favorite is all the attention drawn to her necklace. It’s not too&nbsp;big but it’s also not dainty. Yes, please!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And it might seem against the rules, but what in the world is Dionne wearing?&nbsp;W can literally feel that fuzzy shirt because we all used to wear them. Remember how they looked like doll clothes on the hanger because they were so small? Those were the days.</p><h2 id=pretty-in-plaid>Pretty In Plaid</h2><p>“This is where Dionne lives. She’s my friend because we both know what it’s like for people to be jealous of us,” Cher’s explains as her eyes audibly roll. This is Cher’s number one most popular and easily remembered outfit. At the time, she made what was reserved for lumberjacks and farmers cool. Now we’re in 2018, and she’s bringing it back! It’s too iconic not to happen. Ask anyone (even Google) about a yellow plaid outfit and you’ll hear about this exact one. Again, she takes casual, professional, and fun and mixes it all together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If she had been wearing red plaid or even pink plaid, then it wouldn’t have made it big. But she took what was so outlandish and made it perfect. If a nerdy character would have worn it, they would have&nbsp;ruined it. But since she knew how to make it look good, we're all winners!</p><h2 id=calvin-klein-says-so>Calvin Klein Says So</h2><p>Who can forget the hilarious exchange between Cher and her father in which he accuses this white dress of being basically underwear? It seems that Cher’s favorite little white dress looked like an undergarment to her father. To be honest, we can see where he’s coming from. After all, Calvin Klein does indeed like to make underwear.&nbsp;However, this looks like that perfect little dress we all need. In fact, the dress is so iconic and well-loved that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a> wore a red version in 2012 to the GQ Men of the Year party.</p><p>She looked amazing and almost outdid Cher. But Cher did it twenty years earlier, so she wins. Nowadays, the dress is ten times more modest than most dresses available. So it’s a win-win to wear it out. Plus, there are so many things you can do with it! Wear it with&nbsp;cool sneakers&nbsp;or with a nice cropped jacket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=say-yes-to-the-cuffs>Say Yes To The Cuffs</h2><p>“Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie,” Cher once wisely stated.Ah, Cher, good one. Everyone got so afraid of fur when designers like <a href=#>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</a> got in trouble and outed by PETA for using it. But&nbsp;we are sure that Cher probably wore fake fur because she&nbsp;certainly couldn’t hurt an animal.</p><p>But, you know, she sure did wear a lot of it and back then. She probably accidentally bought a few fur coats with real fur. Remember that fur purse she had? Too soft! At least this one just has fur cuffs, which is actually pretty tasteful. Over the plain white shirt, she has an outfit. Worn with jeans, it would have been forgettable, but since she had that pale green checkered skirt, it looked stunning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-bathing-suit-we-need>A Bathing Suit We Need</h2><p>“I feel like such a heifer. I had two bowls of Special K, 3 pieces of turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn, 5 peanut butter M&M’s and, like, 3 pieces of licorice.” You hog, Cher.&nbsp;We can’t believe you splurged like that! (Kidding, of course.)&nbsp;There are a few reasons why we love Cher’s bikini. For one, it’s surprisingly modest. That sheer wrap actually hides the bare necessities, and her bikini top covers really well. But other than that, it’s also completely adorable. Like a breath of fresh air, her choice in swimming attire is everything we need in this world.</p><p>Gingham was out for a while, but recently has come back into fashion. Thank you, Cher, for bringing it back with one fell swoop of a screenshot. Now it’s time for us to go swimsuit shopping!</p><h2 id=whose-pe-look-is-the-best>Whose PE Look Is The Best?</h2><p>"I would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace," Cher sighs. "I mean, standing in line for forty minutes is hardly aerobically effective. I doubt I've worked off the calories in a stick of care-free gum." How much '90s can you squeeze into one high school PE photo? Although every outfit here is unstoppable, only one of them is timeless. Cher’s athletic shorts, white tee, and black tank will literally never go out of style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you could choose one PE outfit to fit into every decade in the last 100 years, it would be this one. While it isn’t anything fancy, it is one that anyone can wear and anyone can find at literally any department store, even Walmart! Not to mention that Cher amps it up with that incredible bag.</p><h2 id=black-and-white-for-tea-time>Black And White&nbsp;For Tea Time</h2><p>"Well, some teachers are trying to low-ball me, Daddy. And I know how you say, 'Never accept a first offer,' so I figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations," Cher said during this famous scene. Wow, what a way to look at it! Here, Cher pulls off black and white yet again. If you look closely, you can see the pattern on her skirt. It appears to be velvet over satin. Then we have her white sweater over the cream shirt. The look is not one that can be matched. Although we all know the real winner of this outfit&nbsp;– the scrunchie! If you were a girl in the '90s and you didn’t have a scrunchie, did you really even deserve to show your face at school? Cher wears it better than anyone by not overdoing it with bright colors like so many did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-s-an-ala-a>It’s An Alaïa!</h2><p>“To get an Alaïa dress I had to make so many calls. There was really no club promoting at the time, there was none of what’s happening now; it was really all my footwork, trying to bring these designers in. And my budget wasn’t huge, so we used whatever I could get for free, and Alaïa was very generous with the pieces – he was such a collaborative designer,”&nbsp; says costume designer Mona.&nbsp; Yes, we’re talking about the infamous Alaïa scene where Cher is held at gunpoint and is worried about her dress, which would&nbsp;be about $5000 if sold today.This iconic scene would not have been the same with a different outfit. But&nbsp;on top of that legendary dress is a jacket that is so dated that we can’t decide if we want to puke or search for one right now! How Mona got the outfit together is beyond us, but it’s definitely the most expensive outfit that Cher wore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=working-out-in-style>Working Out In Style</h2><p>“Okay, so you’re probably going, 'Is this like a Noxzema commercial or what?' But seriously, I actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl,” Cher said in one of the opening scenes of Clueless&nbsp;that shows&nbsp;her getting ready for her day. But in this scene, she’s working out with Tai to the Buns of Steel videos, which made them pretty popular actually. But you know what else was popularized here? Leotards.</p><p>While Tai’s outfit is so-so, Cher’s looks like it was swiped from a Barbie doll. The pattern is neutral enough since it’s in black and grey. It’s a great exercise choice, but what really makes it stand out is that zig-zag pattern on the back. No one knows how she does it, but she makes everything attractive&nbsp;– even working out. You likely can’t find this leotard anywhere, but we can sure beg for them to start making it again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=headbands-are-back>Headbands Are Back</h2><p>“Until mankind is peaceful enough not to have violence on the news, there's no point in taking it out of shows that need it for entertainment value.” Well said, Miss Horowitz. This button-up skirt is everything! By far, it is our favorite piece of this ensemble, though the thigh-high burgundy socks are close! All around, Cher looks amazing here. The button-up with the sweater vest doesn’t look good on everyone, but she shows us how to pull it off. Put it with this gorgeous burgundy button-up skirt.</p><p>What makes this so much more impressive is Amber’s absolutely atrocious piece back there. Can you imagine wearing that striped body suit? It’s so ugly! There’s a reason Cher is the star here instead of Amber. Cher has more class than the entire high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-beautiful-sheer-cher>A Beautiful Sheer Cher</h2><p>“So okay, I don’t want to be a traitor to my generation and all but I don’t get how guys dress today. I mean, come on, it looks like they just fell out of bed and put on some baggy pants and take their greasy hair and cover it up with a backwards cap and like, we’re expected to swoon? I don’t think so,” Cher said.&nbsp;We have to agree with Cher on this one. In this moment, she’s hanging out with Josh, the one man she feels comfortable with. While he would never actually try to look good, she looks as perfect as always. The idea of wearing a white tank with a black sheer top is unthinkable, but in a good way. With the black pencil skirt, anyone would hire her on sight&nbsp;– not that she’s going for an interview, but she should. And of course she’s just eating carrots; how else would she keep that figure?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-even-better-sheer-cher>An Even Better Sheer Cher?</h2><p>“Everything I think and everything I do is wrong. It all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion, I was just totally clueless,” Cher said about her confusing feelings at the end of the movie. Cher is incredibly lovable, and no one can truthfully say that they don’t like her. But&nbsp;in terms of this outfit, it’s impossible to decide if we like the black sheer or white sheer better. While the black one was great for a job interview, it seems this one may be perfect for roaming the streets and telling yourself that you do everything wrong. Poor, Cher. She really does try so hard!</p><p>She thought to pair a sweater vest with a sheer button-up. The denim shorts underneath really bring it all together. This is the newest thing that&nbsp;we should all be trying in 2018!</p><h2 id=and-there-s-the-casual>And There’s The Casual</h2><p>“I had an overwhelming sense of ickiness,” Cher once famously said. We’ve all been there, Cher, with our ickiness bubbling up inside. Finally, Cher actually wears casual clothes, which is something that we’d all be caught wearing on our day off. We probably all have similar pieces of clothing in our closet; we just never thought about putting them together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone can dress up for a night out but it takes skill to actually look good while doing nothing all day. That’s what this outfit stands for&nbsp;– taking care of yourself no matter who is watching, even if you’re alone. You can be comfy and look good. And looking good, in the end,&nbsp;is for your benefit, so don’t try to impress anyone else!</p><h2 id=the-dress-worth-stealing>The Dress Worth Stealing</h2><p>“She’s a full-on Monet. It’s like a painting, see? From far away, it’s okay. But up close, it’s a big old mess,” Cher scathingly said about her nemesis Amber. We all know people like that! Lucky for us, Cher is pretty up close and from far away! This dress was so fabulous that Amber actually ended up stealing her look and wearing the same one. That is one of the best high school compliments a girl can get – when someone else likes your outfit so much that they copy it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And we totally understand why Amber did it. The dress is one you could wear on a weekly basis for decades and never get tired of it. It seems comfortable, casual, and full of never-ending cuteness. It could even follow you into adulthood.</p><h2 id=the-moment-we-ve-all-been-waiting-for>The Moment We’ve All Been Waiting For</h2><p>“I’m not a prude, I’m just highly selective. You see how picky I am about my shoes, and those only go on my feet,” Cher said about her taste in boys. We can all be highly selective, and absolutely should be. Don’t let any man make you think you need him. Wait until you find someone who is worth your time. That’s a valuable lesson that Cher has taught us in Clueless. For those who don’t remember, this is the moment Cher and Josh have their heart-to-heart and kiss for the first time. What is so special about it is that it happened when Cher wasn’t all dolled up. She was makeup-free and had sweatpants on! Now that is love!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her cut-out top and purple sweats, she really did look adorable though, didn’t she? If only we could all look this good while hanging out at home. Then life would be complete.</p><h2 id=morning-routine>Morning Routine</h2><p>We have to wonder: where does Cher find these outfits?&nbsp;We really wish that they made these PJ sets these days. The midriff-baring might not be the most efficient thing, and&nbsp;we can take it or leave it, but the cozy little set is one that we need in our wardrobe. It’s hard to find something good for the summer, but if you have to get just one pair of PJs, it should be a set like these.</p><p>While she wore multiple different pyjamas in the movie, this one is your best bet. While pink flannel is great, it can get hot and is a bit oversized. Pyjama pants and a tee are safe but overrated. What we need is this cutesy outfit we could fall asleep in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=looking-fierce-in-satin>Looking Fierce In Satin</h2><p>“He does dress better than I do. What would I bring to the relationship?” Spoken&nbsp;like a girl referring to their newly found gay friend.&nbsp;We are pretty sure this is a nightie, but does that make it any less beautiful? Don’t we all need a fuzzy makeup bag with our name printed on it? The feathers can go, as they are so '90s and so "slumber party." We’re keeping everything else. But as long as we get to feel that blue satin gown on our body, we’re all good. Whether we wear it to bed or to a party, that doesn’t matter either!</p><p>This&nbsp;was a promotional shot that got overlooked. That's a sad tale indeed, because the outfit is excellent.&nbsp;The creative team said that they didn’t want Cher to look too mature. That’s likely why this outfit didn’t make the cut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=more-than-a-starbucks-ad>More Than A Starbucks Ad</h2><p>“But by the end of the day, it was, like, the more the merrier. And so if the government could just get to the kitchen and rearrange some things we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion, may I please remind you it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of Liberty! Thank you very much,” said Cher in her famous class speech. That was one of the best speeches that were ever made about immigration. Cher is one of the only people that can actually wear plaid pants and get away with it. On most of us, it looks like grandma’s couch is about to bust. But on her, they look preppy and perfect. But the real showstopper is the headband. We can all do long sleeve shirts over button-ups, but that pink headband is one we need to bring back. The thin ones are cool, but what about the thick bandana ones? We could make these out of a t-shirt!</p><h2 id=the-perfect-dress>The Perfect Dress</h2><p>“I don’t get it. Did my hair get flat? Did I stumble into some bad lighting? What’s wrong with me?” It turns out, no one would turn her down… unless they were gay. The only reason it didn’t work out with her and Christian was because he was gay, obviously&nbsp;– that, and she was in love with Josh. This dress is the best thing that Cher wore the entire movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cher wore dozens of amazing outfits, but what we’re getting at here is that out of all of those outfits, this one is by far the best of all. The little red dress will absolutely never go out of style. It will always be relevant and should always be encouraged. Thanks again, Cher, for all of your stylish wisdom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZraF2ks26vx56pZqCfp7y4tdOzqmanpamzqsDSZquhmaRixLDBy51kpaefoHqiucCzoKefXZ67bn6Pam9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./albert-einstein-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Albert Einstein Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-15-aphrodisiac-foods.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 15 Aphrodisiac Foods</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-highest-grossing-tina-fey-movies.html>10 Highest-Grossing Tina Fey Movies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erin-o-donnell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Erin ODonnell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-auston-matthews-gay-wife-partner-is-he-dating-jordyn-johnson-or-emily-rutledge.html>Is Auston Matthews Gay?
