It’s arguably one of the most versatile and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">functional bags</a> on the market — not to mention one of the more affordable designer options. But with the standard medium size costing somewhere in the $150 range, it can still be a bit of an expense for some shoppers.</p><p>Sure, you can wait for there to be a sale at one of your favorite retailers — but you can also score a great look-alike like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this tote from NNEE</a>. The medium version of this bag costs just $25, which is a much more agreeable price for many of Us. It has a similar vibe to the original with just as much functionality!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NNEE-Water-Resistant-Light-Weight-Nylon-Tote-Bag.jpg><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NNEE Water Resistant Light Weight Nylon Tote Bag</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, June 20, 2022, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>Simply put, the design <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">of this bag</a> is as clean and simple as other iconic totes on the market. It has a rectangular shape made from a water-resistant nylon material, plus a zip top closure. You can choose to pick up this bag in a number of different staple shades, with each one featuring tan brown straps sewn onto the sides. These straps are made from genuine leather on the designer version, but the vegan leather ones on this bag look equally as captivating!</p><p>The one thing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this bag</a> doesn’t have is the extra flap closure that extends over the center of the tote, but that’s not particularly important in terms of functionality. This bag keeps any items you house inside of it safe from the elements thanks to the nylon material, which also makes it feel incredibly lightweight. You can stuff this bag with a slew of essentials and the tote itself won’t weigh it down more!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NNEE-Water-Resistant-Light-Weight-Nylon-Tote-Bag-2.jpg><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NNEE Water Resistant Light Weight Nylon Tote Bag</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25</a> at Amazon!

Shoppers say this is the ultimate bag to use for work or traveling. If you have a vacation on the books, it’s the perfect carry-on that you can pack a change of clothes in, your phone or tablet, makeup bag and whatever else you may need. You’re snagging a similar designer look for less, which countless reviewers say they’re incredibly thankful for.
